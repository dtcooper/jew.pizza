David's girlfriend calls in to offer various negative opinions about him. Vic gives the episode a little structure by asking questions, and listens to David rant about his friend Doug. There's a secret contest hidden in the episode for an attentive listener. We find out the Suzuki SV650S is titled and ready to be sold.",

We quickly find out none of her suitors are good enough for her. David and Cici discuss aging, and open up about their bittersweet experiences with divorce. Chopsticks notwithstanding. Cici tell us about heroin addicted newborns. The two discuss the current president, removal of office and feces. Feces being unrelated, perhaps. Cici talks about her past and present participation in social justice movements. Our strange caller Satan from last week's episode rings. Unmasked as Celeste from Modesto, she reveals a bit about herself. Having trouble deciphering what's true, David and Cici's patience with Satan/Celeste begins to run thin. David's girlfriend calls in to remove Celeste from the line and conducts extensive Internet \"research\" on her (read: stalking). That went well, I think. Comedian and flirt Jesus U. BettaWork walks by the studio and takes David's seat causing David to incept his own show. Cici ends the show in disarray. No update on the Suzuki SV650S.",

Being in the studio is the second most exciting Kristine's done. \"Our topic tonight: Religion.\" The three discuss Judaism, Catholicism, Atheism, and hell. David tells us how sharing pictures of his anus almost cost him a friend. The three talk parasites and relate with their IBS, anxiety, hypochondria. Celeste calls in for the third week in a row, this time with her boyfriend David. We start to learn more about the teenage couple and how they found the show. David and David build rapport, even though teenage David is a Trump supporter and a raging anti-Semite. Kristine adds kissing a woman to her bucket list and talks about her perfect cervix and boyfriend. Previous guest Erika rings to tell her boyfriend Drew that he doesn‚Äôt have a parasite. Drew gets to participate in his favourite segment when the Suzuki SV650S owner calls to sell his bike, and the gang discuss genitals with him. David confronts his brother about not calling the show. Drew stands up for what he believes in: being from New Jersey, shaving his sphincter, and wearing women‚Äôs underwear. A couple on their first date give confessionals. Drew falls for a groupie. David‚Äôs girlfriend calls, tender from the death of her favourite Instagram bunny and scares off the only fan of the show. David farts on air. That went well, I think.",

They thought of starting with a bang by calling Jonathan Cooper to discuss about \"Gay jewish hunter's club\" but ended up in voice mail, that shows that they were un prepared and unplanned about the show. But this always the case for David cooper. The first caller called in to know what really the show is about which both host and guest is clueless about. They both had long talks on stuffs like jews, vegetarianism, drugs, Burning man community and hyper mania. I hope Cooper's girlfriend Miranda called in because no one else did, and ended up roasting Cooper with the help of Roth. I'm sure no audience will be pleased to know about Roth's weird nipples and Cooper's half nails. The show was at peak of craziness when caller Suzuki cheese (unsure) called in just to show she is crazier than the show itself. Though her talks were very unclear, she atleast entertained with her loud singing. Miranda called in again to fill the show, Last caller Alligator and her niece called in just to make the show more boring. For the show that didn't go well. Swatish form India rating with 1 star.

Conversations get boring and  off topic comes in between. It merely seems to be more of a funny  . conversation not with much learning or knowing.  Well I think its highly simple . There are many funny jokes which don't make me laugh. Myself Insiya from India will give this podcast a rating of 2 stars. Great day guys.keep watching [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

David's girlfriend Maranda calls and complains David that he does not want to hear from her. Then David talks about Indian foods and Jewish culture and festival. Then, a surprising call from Jonathan makes the show bit more interesting. Jonathan talks David that he quit smoking 5 - 6 weeks ago and he is boring with Neptune and suggests Neptune to go on a date with David. That went well, I think. In the meantime, Maranda calls back David and complains why he deselects her text. Neptune tells Maranda that she is hilarious and he loves that. David's friend Nick calls the show and shows his interest to sell his bike. David tells 'I would like to consider selling my butthole but it's not a legal thing to sell'. Maranda calls again and asks David what we gonna eat dinner tonight. Neptune tells Maranda - 'I can't wait to see you actually in person Maranda'. Ganesh from India rates this episode 3.5 star!",

Mischa likes guys but doesn't like penis. Mischa becomes nervous when David tells about the topic is Holocaust but that doesn't stop him to entertain people. Although French men are homosexual and dirty as Mischa says but he is completely heterosexual who has a well-defined list of girls that he already slept with. Suddenly a surprising call from Sean, 28 years old, grown up in Baleh comes. Sean has honesty in noodles and likes to drink fireball. That went well, I think. David tells Mischa that \"you always do the right thing\", no matter whether going to Barcelona or filing tax return for the first time. David's long time listener Maranda tells she needs more abusive and confusing relationships and she has very confusing comments about feminism. David is telling her \"life begins with masturbation.\" Suddenly another caller Michael talks about dryer clothes in seven minutes and homosexual as free-range. He makes an alarming comment that he did not cry on his father's death. Ganesh from India rates this episode 4 star!",

Dan gives a shout out to his friend that manipulated him into getting a pedicure with them. Then they call one of Chrissy and Kyle and talk about how to make inappropriate jokes. Later they talk about the last time Dan was on the show which resulted in a fight between them but now they are cool. That went well, I think until David insult's Dan family again. Miranda call's again and scolds them for downgrading the quality of the show and reminds Dan to flush the toilet when he pees because it's disgusting. I agree. Then the crew gets into a deep conversation about art, functionality and electronics stores. David's brother Jon call's the show and they start talking about heartwarming stories about sibling's and how Dan brother got traumatized. David reveals that he once told Drake that if he didn't finish his high school he would never be successful, he was wrong. Adolf Hitler rates this episode 4 stores out of 5.

It's just not a good joke. Getting a call form Joseline, Miranda's sister was a surprise for them, Cooper and Alex are not happy about 18 year old Joseline's 32 year old boyfriend, and it went on like a stupid investigation. The feedback of \"fist in my vagina\" should be the exact short review for this show. The show took a serious turn when Alex discussed about sexual harassment, that was the only good part of the show. Then two callers a guy and a girl spoke together thinking it was a show about sex, lol. The show ended with call form Miranda, Cooper's girlfriend, surprisingly she had something good to talk about david when asked. Swatish form India rating this with 2 stars",

David introduces the comedian and tennis instructor, Dan Linley. Some insane and profane remarks are thrown around by both of the speakers as if they don't mind who is listening. They speak as though molestation and pedophilia are things that are normal, this show is honestly ungodly. Nothing they talk about is related to anything except the profanity they use. Why do people have to bring up gay-ism, sexual perversion, sexism, racism or inappropriate jokes in order to get people's attention? These guys have no idea if there is such a thing as too much profanity. Suprise, there is. To their credit, at least some constructive discussions were made on sexism and culture at some point in the show. Generally, I feel this was a complete waste of time. However, since they were able to buy the equipment and record this show, they earn a star. my name is David from Kenya and I give this episode that didn't go well, I think a rating of 1 star.",

The ampersand gal was quite not open about being polygamous, still she calls her partners as friends, thats crazy though. Women bicycle without shirt without getting objectified! Cooper and Caliban were staying at some point that no techie would be listening to the show, still Caliban gave a lot of techie tech information. Both lost their mind when that crazy women just called in to get \"Attention\" sounded super crazy and I want to do it one day. The other callers sounded normal, and one caller refused to discuss about personal life though that is what the entire show is all about, LOL why call? While Cooper and Caliban were talking about getting butterflies on first few parties, that is so real, and anyone would relate to it.

This greatly brought the David's motivation down that he had to say millions of filler words like aahh.. uhmm for the initial 12 minutes. Its nice to hear David panic and ruin the show, but honestly its already ruined from before they start. They choose topic \"Noise pollution\" then moved to \"What is difficult about Christmas this year?\" where none of them went well, I think.

There are caller's in the episode that are connected with Atish Mehta like his sister who interviewed his brother about his weird things he like to do were Atisha felt awkward but still he keeps on riding the questions showing his natural way of attitude of being easy to be with and also his girl friend Nicole, David played funny jokes to her saying to Atisha about her, he says 'What is the taste of her butt hole?\"\", and this questions really made me laugh too much. Lots of callers were on the line up asking questions to Atish about his passion as a DJ and makes him proud, David rank his episode least of all, he really hates his own show. that do not make sense to me. I am Dhruv from India, indian like atish and he remind of me of that and I am rate this episode with 4.5 stars.",

Guest Celeste, 20, who is having a gap from school, feels better working at cafe and for most people she is like Mexican. Suddenly, Josi makes a call and talks David if he is making profit out of the show. David suggests Celeste that Josi is very free spirited. Celeste who believes in pro-abortion tries to make her Mom believes that she loves guys and she is not lesbian. That went well, I think. Elisa makes a surprising call and tells David that she is calling to the show because Celeste is her friend and she wants to say hi and also tells that it's appropriate to be friend with a 19 years girls but David insists that don't call him daddy on social media. In final part, host David talks about Jewish tradition and circumcision and concludes the show thanking guest Celeste for giving him idea to have one psychic in the show. Anand from India rates this episode 4 star!",

David is so proud to announce himself as a gay and I feel sorry about Miranda. Except he's not really gay i think. It's stupid. The show had a mix of sh*t stuff like \"grabbing microphone from female reporter\" and pussy, a bad comedian who made bad rape jokes, Alexander the architect, hearing munching snack sounds, f*cking the right pussy, pee hole, jewish pee and lot of poop. The story about peters' ex-girlfriend was bit sad, at last the were trying hard to pull in callers with expired snickers bait, as no one turned up to call the show, i am not suprised no one called so they called Miranda who pulled David's leg and tried to spoil his name as much as possible. It sounded more like a long boring discussion, I would like to pay David a million dollar (If I had) so to stop doing this show. Swatish form India rates this stupid podcast with 1 star, I would rate with -1 if it is allowed. Very bad. [Editor's note: a -1 star rating is allowed. And it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

A caller then dials in from a few blocks away - the man happens to work for Mozilla (of Firefox fame). The next caller Tony (visiting from the UK) was hilarious but he probably maxed out his cards paying for roaming. I was glad when he finally got off - the show was going a bit sideways at that point. David struck an apologetic tone with Oli for his teeny gaming persona but Oli was pretty sporty about it. And Tony pops up again - does that bloke ever give up? Christian (from the gaming days), whom David tried to call earlier in the show, leaves a text but he's unable to get past his voicemail. And guess what? - think I'll step out for a pizza too.

I breathed a sigh of relief when our man was off after giving us some ginger insights. David gets Miranda to call in and we get the load on David's bottom burps, among other things.

David Cooper's chat was so funny with some bad words, but that's not seen as a big issue in this episode. It was great when he mostly accepted to improve the episode which was requested by Indians fan Banu and Svatish. Not only from them, from my side also i request you to run this show with a reasonable topic. As the show has international following, the topic may also bring any changes. But David Cooper is really a great man who publicly read out the comments given by the followers though it has bad reviews. Overall the show was good to hear and it was a funny 2 hours spent in my life listening to a topic less speech. Miranda girlfriend of david is nice to listen.

After sharing some interesting comic field notes, Nick and David get the first caller on the line - how else could it be other than Borat taking some trivia-time off between drinking alone in a bar, watching people use chopsticks and not sleeping much. And I had one of those bulb moments and got reminded of watching Steve Jobs introduce 'Podcasting' in 2005 - the man termed it as a concatenation of 'iPod' and 'Broadcasting' - you're right, David. Moving on, Nick reveals his Jewish credentials and a pretty elaborate one at that. An upbeat sounding Miranda then calls in (I think the 'Womanizer' is back in action!). Jokes aside, it's always nice to hear her. David then returns the call to someone who tried calling in and the two end up talking to an even keeled (or maybe up & down) Patrick from Texas.

David talk from Neptune about his work. Sometimes he talks some funny thing like he asks Neptune about her sister like she is hot or not. Neptune shares some bad thing about his job. David also asks t Neptune about some adult thing. David shares such thing about Miranda and his love thing. This part of the show I really like. The first caller name I guess \"tony\" is looking very exciting. He talks very fast his voice not clear but I think he is really looking happy to talk with David. In the last part of the show there was alen, But I don't know about alen, why he was he there. So, this was a nice talk, I am sunil from India rating this talk show 4 star. Thank you.",

Chicken John is in the guest seat this week and our very own Colonel Sanders proves to be an opinionated man with the gift of the gab - starting with the upcoming California gubernatorial primaries and punctuated by side-boobs, we get a run down on the state of affairs, Qatar and even mundlebread! That was a good one, David! The first caller turns out to be a sport and lightens things a bit. The Chicken is so right about Trump supporters. Nixon and Universal Basic Income, really? - I learned something new today. The ever so sharp Miranda then calls in and I thought she had someone cling onto his plumes there for a few minutes; even gave me a goal for the rest of the month -brush my teeth with showmanship! One second thoughts, maybe not - it sounds too toothpaste heavy. Before we close for the week, Jamie Bond gets on the line after a night out from across the pond. Is that 138 miles or kilometers per hour?! Cos I thought they had real strict speed limits in England. Oh I forget, Bond makes his own rules after all. And you know what, I reckon you should have 'Tony time' towards the end of the show and close on a high note. That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this highly infotaining episode with 4.5 stars - that went pretty well, I think.",

I mean I am unsure whether this was a joke or what since I don't know who this Joseph Ugalde really is even after googling him yet some parts of the show were funny and entertaining yet in the same time, some parts of their discussion were annoying and appeared to be heading nowhere. Although I was extremely skeptic initially regarding this guest, at some point he actually freestyled a song and his singing voice was nice- that went well, I think! At some point, a caller went live on air, her name was Miranda, she appeared to have an obsession with her feet and kept talking about a \"foot peeling\" chemical she got off Amazon - this part was really weird. Like this wasn't weird enough, the rest of the conversation with the caller included discussions on masturbation, vibrators and.... Drake?! Anyway, considering I've heard way more absurd and pathetic radio shows, George from Romania will rate this episode 2 stars!",

Naderi is Maz Jobrani lite and sounds pretty laid back. After a brief call from his (apparently crazy) roomie, he goes on to talk about his Dad, who moved to the country before the Iranian Revolution. David Roth (of Courtyard by Marriott fame) is our next caller, and he doesn't exactly mince his words when it comes to what he thinks about the show. After some pushing and prodding, Cooper admits that he's had some beef with Roth and makes an effort to come clean. Jamie Bond, all set to leave on his next mission to the Korean Peninsula, interrupts the call. I can't help imagining what new shit he's going to stir up - we should get a progress report this time, next week. For all you know, the South Koreans might fly him to Singapore for some fruity comic relief while the two overweight men meet, Trump and Tony. Straight shooter and WebEx hater Miranda then calls in to put Cooper in his place, followed by Roth who rings back to clear the air. After Roth hangs up, Naderi shares some of his experiences living abroad. Cooper brings the curtain down for the week, but not before a few plugs for shows both the men have coming up. That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this episode with 4 stars - that went pretty sour free, I think.",

God! she is really great to accept her everything in her own. \"sammmm antha\" . hahaha hilarious samantha. I wear t-shits sound like I am gay. Its very stupid. Cooper sounds very much funny. The show is useful but seems boring. David talks more than the guest and miranda is ridiculous she doesn't even know that she is still in the line. God..! such a poor podcast.Make it better by making some enthusiastic this. but David sounds responsive. He knews thats he is the one who can make this show good. Gosh just do that man. Rather than saying take the responsibility and do it. overall a not bad a good one. I am Aaradhya. \"Not bad\" consists of bad in it so please make it good. This is must Go well David!

    "description": "I can't understand the motive of the show. I don't know what he tries to talk. The starting itself is a great mess. He shouts unnecessarily during the conversation. It makes me very tensed and angry and I got frustrated in the starting itself. It was a great insult for David Cooper by the first caller. The question was how come this show has come up to 79 episodes and it was nice question by the caller. But the answer by him was irritating that he cannot know to answer for this question. He was adding it as child and the words used in the shows is unpleasant. Even the guest using the words such as f**k randomly. No one can hear this type of shows. The first caller was dating. Unnecessary talks takes place in this show. The guests does not behave themselves properly as the guests. First of all f**k your show. Oh my god what type of show is this? I can't even hear it for a minute. It was very boring with unwanted talks. Why this show is conducted by him? In my personal thoughts this show is waste of time filled only with unwanted talks. There is no useful things in this show. Highly frustrated after listening to the talks. The title of the show is not at all suit with the talks. They are thinking that it is going well but it was the whole mess. In order to pass their own time they are conducting this stupid show. This show makes me highly angry because of their unwanted stupid talks. \"Fucked on the pizza\" Is this very important for this show? This show is not to discuss about each other's bed experience. I am really confused whether this is a show or a matrimony?? I can't understand the second caller's motivation. Why he called and what he wants to get things from these stupids? Unwanted noises behind the shows is not at all a good sign for a valuable show. From this the importance they have given to the show is known by us. A 20 year old girl is all the chief guest for this show. They are just making fun of each others. They are getting tired or not after listening to this stupid I get really tired and frustrated. I think both the men have come to know the details of the girl who have come as a guest because she is a small girl and they are asking about the boy friend . It is very stupid behavior. Would you sleep with your sister is a f**k question. I am really depressed because of this show. They are even insulting the callers. What is there about to talk about AVI and the dating with it. The conversations is jumping as they like. There is no order and it was not at all like a show. Full of sexual talks. David is very proud to say him as a gay and it was very stupid. Oh my god I can't bare their idiotic talks. In this situation he is singing and can't able to hear that voice. But for my relief I can hear the song for my relaxation but it was also not played full and while playing the song the idiotic talks is interfered. The question of the fifth caller is somewhat useful I think but it was messed with the stupid answers. They are talking stupid always. If I was an anchor I would have done it better than David. I can't even accept this as a radio show. I beg Mr.David Cooper not to conduct this type of show hereafter. I can't bare this type of unnecessary talks. It they asked me to rate this show I will always rate this as negative as I can. Very bad, worst show I have ever heard till now. That went well, I think. I am Karishma.",

David brings up the recent outing of Shitbag and Dan is not happy with how the show went. An apologetic David floats the idea that he could take a step back and have someone else fill in. From what I can make out, the show is still in it's infancy and it's probably a good time to try if something new works. Annie's plug for her new show, 'Bottomless Standards' is interrupted by the evening's first caller- Womanizer's greatest fan! Talk about silken ocean waves and minute long crests - you know, I was thinking - maybe the Germans could use that line for one of their ads, but good luck matching Miranda's conviction. Tina, the next caller may have tripped on some outcropping and hung up. And yeah, think I was a bit Arachnophobic too but I've gotten over it over the years - trekking in a rainforest sure helps! Vic rings in and takes things on a different tangential. For a second there, I wasn't sure whether to feel happy or sad for our Obama fan. That aside, it sounds like Dan has some interesting shows in the pipeline.

The two get the show going by striking up some banter before David reveals that his ex is having a child - listening to him talk about it, you kinda get the feeling that it's been on his mind a lot - or maybe not. Wrong Sara to the wrong Gabe! - insane indeed. Wonder what the odds on something like that would be!? Talking about odds and sanity, you don't have to go far to find someone who pushes both - it's our Bond from across the pond! Apparently Tony has been going around trying to get random people to wear David's cutout face masks - a topless woman with Cooper's face sounds hilarious - looks like Tony has his work cut out. On second thoughts, he might pull it off while he's out walking his dog - I wouldn't be surprised. After Tony hangs up, a couple of persistent teenagers ring in from the street and throws Cooper off, slightly. It's Sara's turn when he hears David's views Ali Wong's comedy. I reckon Cooper was on to something when he talks about one's choice to get offended. A drowsy sounding Miranda calls in before the curtains go down for the week. Always something, indeed!

But David persists, and persist he does - albeit with the help of Miranda and Tony - Jon chips in as well. You know, with the kind of upbeat radio persona Tony puts on week after week, you sometimes tend to take it for granted that he may be the same in real life too. It was refreshing to hear him open up and take us for a peek behind the curtains - only to be derailed by McNuggets! - yes Tony, only on the David Cooper show indeed! Well, Tony manages to get himself invited for Jon's wedding later in the summer, and I have a feeling he's going to make it. If he does, it sure is gonna be a riot!

    "description": "Episode 89 (not 69) of \"This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper\" and today's guest on the show is Dan Linley after Trish Pandey rescheduled to sometime in November. Quite early in the show there is a call who hangs up. Dan has a list of things to be discussed on the show. They go on to discuss Davids butthole, not the best part of the show. The first call on the show is from Clint, who works for San Francisco parks alliance, a non-profit. and they discuss a bunch of parks. The next caller is Vic. They go on crack jokes on the Jews. They have a long Q&A. Then Dan has a verbal diarrhea on the Kardashians, who he hates to the core. The next caller is the show regular, Tony. Tony has testy relation with Dan. Then we get a dose of typical Tony humor, but its quite subdued. The last caller is another regular Miranda, who has fought with her. One of the boring David Cooper shows in recent times. This is Karti from India rating the show a 1 out of 5.",

    "description": "It sure feels like ages - am I glad to be listening to Cooper again or what!? Sounds like the show has even moved up the ladder with a new station picking up the feed - way to go! David gets things rolling with his usual drill and introduces his guest Tracy Nguyen. However, the episode gets off the blocks with a whimper. Tracy brings up something that I've often wondered too - why does David get worked up when someone refers to the show as a podcast?! Miranda then makes an early call in and the three get chatting. But it doesn't take long before our leading man from across the pond calls in. Between tinder swipes, ass wipes, getting rimmed, boob squeezes and being on call to Her Majesty's Drone service, our man in London still makes his Friday morning dates. That's commitment! Tony comes to Cooper's rescue when he needs him the most - kinda like a laxative for the show (although Tony might argue it's the other way around!). After Tony hangs up, Cooper and Tracy strive to salvage the rest of the episode. Cooper goes on to play a hilarious clip from Burning Man. The curtains come down for the week with a karaoke duet which to be honest, cracked me up. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this sing-along episode with 4 stars - that turned out well in the end, I think.",

The discussion was so boring, Gallow hung up without saying good bye. Finally another caller Miranda, who had to hold on till they dispensed off with Rommey.

A few interesting callers from across the glass divide and Miranda's call line the first hour - I'll probably see pink salmons in a whole new light from this day forth. But 'Adolf Gasser' has to take the weird snippet award for the week. David's childhood friend Jacob calls in and spills some of their peccadillos, which set things up nicely. Our man from across the pond then calls in and the show kinda enters a whole new level of reality. It was hilarious and painful at the same time. Oh yeah, talk of the Atlantic Ocean being a cock-blocker! - Well, maybe not for our drone man - but that's a good one Pamela! Oh Jenny, my Jenny! - full marks to her for being a sport.

Vampire fetish, period-sex towels, and hemorrhoids - can't say I've heard all three in one sentence before. Clara brings up something I hear all too often these days - how much it bothers parents to bring up children in the era of technology. And before long we're on communes and goat farming - boy we're running the whole gamut here! The outside phone line sees from frantic activity towards the very gay end of the episode, with our very own Banksy reveal - that was a good one, Clara! And just when the thought crossed my mind that Bond may have fumbled his Daylight Savings clock - I hear that all too familiar laugh. Boy does he work on his props or what?! - sounds like Mr. T has got a drop though. We sure have a transatlantic meeting to look forward to later this month.

We have two tattoo-free guests at the Ritual for the 94th - David's mom Clara and funnyman, 212-pounder Paul Conyers! After attending to an early caller through the glass, the three settle in to get things rolling. Well, what do you know - it's truly a family show this week and Sr. is right - even a Jesus can't get through the Mexican border right now, let alone applying for asylum on the second coming. And if you ask me - we sure could do with a lot more loosey-goosey hippie rabbis, especially in the Middle of East or the Middle of West rather, looking from my side. You know what, I'm not sure if I've heard a more articulate funnyman on the show before, not to mention the spot-on German accent - he had me cracking up all the while. The lill' trip down comic-memory lane was pretty insightful too. Before bringing the curtains down, both David and Paul make a quick plug for the shows they have lined up - sounds like fun. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with nearly 4 stars - I've got enough to publish a paper on bum-wipes now, I think.",

The guest is open to new experience and the conversation runs around age and enters into the co artist of the guest as comedian. There is a healthy conversation between them and she said on her 30th birthday happenings about her day and the pizza shop and the conversation went over .And lot of background noise is also there and conversation runs on cbd. The gay topic conversation doesn't went well and it's awkward and overall the word \"fuck\" is mostly used all over the show. There is no particular topic in this conversation but here and there pizza shop was discussed. The yawning sound of the host towards the end of the show seems bad and the discussion about orgasm is fishy. Nearly 12 callers participate in the show.The discussion about children sounds better in the overall show but probably there is no goal in the show and the rating is 1 out of 5 from Rathina, India.",

Fifteen minutes into the show i am bored out of mind, hearing cat stories is making me kill me. The guest has very soft voice and that helped me sleep. Till we get a caller, its Miranda, one of my favorites. Finally we get some traction in the show. Then Miranda goes on bore us with questions for Ben.

Caller said some word about the word in his T-shirt. They talked about their boring life. Caller was returning to home after the work. David just said that Krista is very dirty. But krista said that her mom praised about her cleanliness. Half of the show David telling that the Krista is dirty really funny. 2nd caller is really interesting and she shared about her life things. Good story will be rewarded with the original poster. Really funny. Fucking Jesus christ is the Only word keep on repeating from David. It's really pathetic show and this audio will be really a crap and wasting a time in your life by hearing this. Once you heard this audio you will feel very funny and you will be getting the time waste. 4th caller story is really boring. If you need to waste the time please hear it otherwise leave this crap.

There was some bad thing happen when the first caller Miranda is calling but David is not received her call, this is a very bad manner, Mr. David Cooper. I am surprised that there is no any caller to call on this show. I think the good part of this conversation is a political discussion.

They are going to start a new podcast. They have their friends call up on the show and we have four of their friends call up in quick succession, one of them named Susan Butt who tries to hook in with Roberto. That was the boring part. The shows starts to kick in when Tony calls up, who sounds a bit subdued but is still fun. Later we have Miranda call in and the fun begins. The conversation between David and Miranda are the best part of the show. I enjoy them the most. Better get new/interesting guest on the sow or it will continue downhill. This is Karti from India rating this episode a three out of five. One of better shows.",

    "description": "If you want cringes, go for this podcast, which for some reason insists on being called a radio show. A forty something Pamela is the guest of episode 107. She is clearly a post wall woman who still wants to appear hot and desirable to guys. I feel sorry for the callers. First guy called and she pretty much made herself his girlfriend or at least a date while the guy had little to no interest in her. Second caller was a catholic and was forced to hung up with discussions of arse and sh*t. The most cringe-worthy moment was when David was talking about masturbating next to his mother and Pamela started moaning and David shut her up. Even Miranda, David's girlfriend, called in between the show and literally told her to shut up. Eww, must have hit hard on the woman. Didn't go well for her I guess. Sandeep from India rates this show 3 star. Three star because it's one those \"so bad they're good.\" [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

They go on to answer some questions by Vic. Elon Musk, you need to hear Miranda's views on the Tesla design. They go on to reminiscent their first date, first event. We get the first caller and its Tony and no, I am not on the David's lousy payroll. And yes I love Miranda :) Tony has certainly piqued my interest on the The Abduction. They go on to discuss David's ex-wife. After Tony, they go on to discuss an almost threesome. They return to Vic's questions. We get an argument and then an awkward silence and David pouring his heart out over his relapse into drug addiction. Come on Drugs, not cool. Then its back to Vic's questions. Till we get the next caller, Frankie, who was on a date, Miace, who give us good couple Made-for-each-other story. With Miranda in the house sparks were bound to fly, but not the type we witnessed. One of best shows episodes and had really heartfelt moments. This is Karti from India, rating this episode a 4.5 out of 5.",

It seems David Cooper only know one form of comedy, that is sexual or vulgar comedy. If you want to break up with your boyfriend, call this show because David will manage to do that. He will tell you hidden desires of your boyfriend, without even speaking to him, that will make you vomit. I'm glad the couple that called in this episode hung up before they reached that stage. I pray for their quick recovery for the trauma they sustained by talking to David. And for the trauma these 3 hours of listening to this show caused me, I will call this show a podcast, because I know that pisses David off.

David host the program with some great questions and he makes this show rocking. They talked about some topics with the callers. callers had some great fun. I'm really surprised to hear this kind of show in radio show. But this is really unique and it is good to hear about it. They talked about trump supporters. Talked about time travelers. Talked about the poop and hand wash. David likes to sneeze more and when the sun hits him he likes to sneeze. After sneezing when the liquid smells odd and then it is bad breathe problems.

Ray Connolly is an advertising freelancer who clearly isn't satisfied with his current work and wants to do music. Interestingly David also plays music which is good to know. I came to know that David does standup comedy too. What I found interesting was their talk about therapists. Ray was either high or depressed (or both. But not saying it in negative way.) Not many callers today. David revealed he was 32, but to be frank he doesn't sound 30+. He appears like someone in early or middle twenties, at least from voice. In this episode it felt like David was restraining himself, which is a change because he generally otherwise goes haywire with the flow.

After that they were discussing about the movies. David is very interesting and love to have sex with stranger. Dan told i think i won't imagine with the unknown people. David told Rachel as you are the good human being because he told i didn't see the body. They both talk to Dan as if you are get pregnant do abortion. Then get pregnant with constipation and going to become a mom. Three had fun together and laughing. A caller called, David thought he was drunk and made some funny comments but it turned out the caller had mental disability and David felt really bad after that. Well, repenting is the path of forgiveness, which is exactly what the next caller pointed out who was a nurse. They discuss about Dan family. He attended the phone call and do bad jokes. Overall it is very irritating to hear. They talked about sex very often. Dan talked about her interests in sex,movies and discuss about producer. They discuss the website go to match.com. Finally he wish to list 4 things. Dan Linley is talkative. Moreover the discussion is about sex. Overall the show is not interesting and it was very bad.

Ezra is a musician and has lived in many cities. And we get the best joke of the show on MJ. Then we have a long discussion on therapists. And things are boring till David calls Ezra's parents and it clean fun. Its been an hour now, but no caller yet. Finally we get a caller/call picker, Sheera, a recently graduated student. The next caller hangs up quickly. Then we finally get to Ezra's singing, and he is quite good at it. We got back to some serious discussion on religion and other things.This is Karti, back to reviewing the show, from India rating this show a 3 out of 5, one of better episodes without the regular callers like Miranda or Tony and only 2 callers for the whole show.",

And we get the first passerby of the day. The next passerby is another Jew, a dance performer. the show is going on a bit boring ,mode, till we get the next caller, an anti capitalist. We gone on to have a long discussion on capitalism. A Canadian from Edmonton, who has a thing against the Edmonton mall. She has some really depressing ideas for the humanity, she is like the female version of Thanos, wanting to wipe out half of humanity just to start over again. We get a benny hill trumpet player who's banned from the revolution cafe, where you can start a revolution. The show is missing its regulars like Miranda, Tony, they formed the highlight of the show, hoping for more of them in the future episodes.

Back after 2 weeks and we have an old timer guest who is visiting the show the fourth time, looks like they she doesn't have anything else going in her life. The first caller couple leave hurriedly to have sex I assume. We get to know that David to be divorced and is currently with Miranda, a red head. The show somehow get a lots of cranky caller including some regulars. We get a call from Takashi, and at the same time we get Nick on a call. We get a man named Collin coming in, and a very talented saxophone player on alot of marijuana. I really dont know what to make of this show, it has some good highlights but the cons out weigh the pros by a long margin. too much sex, and lots of swearing are the biggest problems of the show. This is Maruu from India, rating this shit show a 1 of 5 points. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

    "description": "This is probably one of the longest running train wrecks out there - I'm not sure if I would've put my money on it, but here we are. Cooper has his comedian friend David Roth in the guest seat, again. Things get off the block with the first caller for the evening before we are taken for a little, not-so rehashing walk down the Cooper-Roth friendship lane. Roth then proceeds to shed some light on his comedic apprehensions and challenges, which I thought was quite insightful. And that bit about jew.pizza and the oven - that was some connection to come up with! About half way in, we get someone from the other side of the glass posing The question: what's the premise of the show? For a second, I thought Cooper was going to take the bait but he chose the admirable dodge. And talking about our missing man from across the pond, it's almost eerie to not hear the bloke laugh. Oh well! An Austrian woman then rings in from the street and I thought she suddenly put some life into the episode. Some of the callers who followed her were quite funny too. And that Mariano character, what does he smoke? He's psychotic. Moving on, looks like Roth has some interesting shows coming up. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with 4 stars - not so rennet-free but still very much edible, I think.",

    "description": "The show begins with David Cooper introducing his show \"This is going well, I think\" and after listening to it i feel like that it did indeed go well or at-least i think it did. The show seems quite casual, sometimes a little bit too causal that it almost seems downright unprofessional. The topics were all over the place some funny, some were personal, some cringe-worthy and some outright inappropriate. I am just glad atleast out of the two speaker David and Willie (The famous guy from Reebok ad/the show's guest), Willie actually confronted David Cooper when he went overboard. Some remarks were disrespectful and inappropriate (retards, mom's vaginas). The callers were interesting my favourite one was the woman who didn't give her name, she called when they were speaking about Willie stealing a bowling ball; I think it brought out the best of both the speakers and they were very comfortable discussing it and cracking jokes. David sometimes made medical jokes which i think most audience would not get but could be very enjoyable for some people in the field, like me. I think it'd be great if David learnt to shut his trap once in a while like when Willie was talking about Tim Olsen \"Tim Olsen, you fish killer!\", That was golden; needed to be continued. Though unprofessional its smoothness and continuity made me like it. The show ends on a fungal note. Chris Maxwell from India rates this episode that went well 4 stars. Good Show.

I never seen a show like this very slow. Callers talked about the animal love and david didn't like animals and the caller was not happy with the answer. She wants everyone to love animals. Only pet animals can be loved. Discussing about the cancer patient and it is making some what very sad and it is not happy to hear about it. David was very energetic through out the show. They didn't leave any break. Thump up for their energy level. I need some what concepts so that the radio show will be reached more numbers of people. I would rate 2 star for this show.

The next receiver, Ellen, hates ritual coffee and we get a next caller is Miranda, Davids girlfriend. If i thought David uses too many cuss words, just listen to Alyssa and your ears will bleed. She goes on to tell a story of how she fired her therapist over a small issue. The conversation goes nowhere all through the show. She also got into an argument with a passerby. It was like she was minutes away from a nervous breakdown. It was borderline bizarre. Even David had to apologize to her, dont know why.

Finally a caller, the first caller, is Miranda, David's girlfriend and we get another Alegra, a professional clown, Then we get some poop stories, next we get a Bolivian caller, who kicks off a discussion on dictators. The show sounds very long and really gets boring in the middle, it never picks up after a flat start. The guest is quite boring and show requires someone exciting and interesting to pick off from.

    "description": "I just listened to the podcast titled \"This is going well, I think by David Cooper\". It is apparently the 130rd episode, I am surprised it's been going on so long given the type of conversations they have. David is ruthless with the people he interviews. He is invasive, childish and sometimes funny. Although these factors don't necessarily make him a bad interviewer. He goes in so deep that you can see the person who he is interviewing bare which makes them more relatable and easy to feel for. One of the guests of the day was Monica, after listening to her talk. I feel inspired by her character just by knowing that she came on the show given all her insecurities. Her story about the tattoo which symbolises not always being able to succeed was something new and refreshing. I personally didn't like the second guest as much. I also noticed that Monica stopped talking as much after the second guest came in, probably because of her being socially incompetent like she discussed. Annick Adelle from what I gather is a lesbian who kinda hates many things like men, balls with hair and apparently jews. She seems very open and very outgoing which is the opposite of Monica. So it felt like the chemistry was off, it would have been way better if it was done separately. All in all I think that went well. Chris from India rates this show 4 stars out of 5.

But what does that mean in case of the great host of this great show David Cooper? It means more vulgarity, more profanity and more bad jokes. It appears that David is beginning to carve out his space, because now callers appear to match David's level. They have begun to share and reciprocate David's passion and personality of being bad. Not evil type of bad but poor type of bad, like not bad boys but bad song or bad vegetable. So, with David at center, the whole environment becomes like that - the guests, the callers, even the viewers- like me. So yeah, being in that mindset and still under influence, I, Sandeep from India, rate this episode 4 out of 5 stars for bringing the bad back.",

    "description": "The podcast or as they call it a radio show on their website jew.pizza is called \"This is going well I think with David Cooper\". Funny thing happened, at some point the host and his guest Sequoia talk about weird domain names and that's when I realised that I too was one of those fools who didn't believe that the website was real. I have been through many episodes up until now. I always thought it was a running joke of the show. I checked the site out for real this time, well what do you know it exists. I think David needs to announce that it is real website. Here I was thinking that David is a bit anti-semitic or thinks that jew are too fat. Sorry David! This episode was refreshing, especially because of the guest. The show started with David's usual intro. I know he's done it 138 times but damn that intro sounds like it is pre-recorded. I wonder if he practices it in front of the mirror before sleeping. The guest was also a radio show host. It felt so weird. At some points you wonder who really is the host of the running show. Sequoia definitely gave Cooper a run for his money. Sequoia has been doing it for a longer time and it shows. I hope Sequoia gave some pointers to David and that he uses it to better this atrocity. Chris from India gives this show 5 stars.",

    "description": "This is a podcast what tells stupidity in a funny way.It is weird but entertaining .David cooper is a guy who seems to be mad and funny at the same time.This episode had a funny guest who is a comedian and a philanthropist as told by David cooper.She was very lively and talkative who kept the show competent and people may not get bored.But i can say stupidity is promoted a lot. David welcomes her and she is delighted.He asks her about her boyfriend .she says he is Ryan and he is funny too.They fall in love in six days or so.Then they says about their mood swings .they discusses about their psychiatric treatments and drug doses too.weird .Then a caller comes who is thirty nine who was having fun at home.Then again calls come and go the phone dies and that didn't go well with David cooper i think and he was stressed.Another caller talks about insta and photos.Another caller does not speak and so on.Natasha laughs aloud and David says he has own computer.wow great.They starts to speak sex and callers too.What a culture less show,but it is funny too.So Katy from Bahrain rates this show with 3 stars.

    "description": "God, this David Copper guy sounds like he is eating a shoe while dancing lambada. How did this guy think he could have a podcast? I don't know if he sounds worse when his pitch is going up and down, all uncontrolled, like a bunch of cool cats playing jazz, or when he tries to sound like professional radio and the attempt is just laughable. His co-host, Tracy, is not any better, repeating exact lines the same as he said them for no reason but waste the listener's time. The notion that some podcasters have - and a lot of the media, sadly - that everyone's opinion on politics is relevant is one of the greatest plagues on our culture. I literally have no idea who would want or care to hear about what some random thinks about politics. They should stick to their jokes - I mean, after learning to actually make them funny. Between the completely meaningless political commentary, and the awful jokes, I think the rest went well. Except of course there was nothing else besides that, and the show is unbearable. If this show had 2 minutes, it might be bearable albeit useless. To listen to this for two hours should be enough to be paid a nice amount of money, and even then it would be torture. This gets a zero from Takashi from Hawaii. Infinitely prefer Dr. Pepper to David Cooper. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

    "description": "Boring episode, probably because of somewhat boring callers. \"Future ex-wife\", nice phrase used by David, heard it first time. Another nice phrase was by a caller calling for having a \"2020 vision\" for next year. Nothing much to remember from the episode. Oh, and David Cooper officially called this show a PODCAST! He specifically said it is a podcast, not a radio show. Then why in the hell does his website jew.pizza keep reminding us in the face that it's NOT a podcast? Explain this contradiction!! I like the callers though. They seem to be simple, down to earth people. We internet people tend to forget all these things in our hypocritical social circle. This show happening in a physical coffee shop, letting people call from outside phone booth, broadcasting on radio, and letting people do phone calls.. all these things seem to bring a sense of old tradition, and with it the groundedness. Although David himself, like me, is pretty hypocritical, but it seems he craves honesty, groundedness, interacting with down to earth people. And that's why he made this show this way. Sandeep from India rates this episode 2 out of 5 stars. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

I think, that this show went well but in some place it shows very unnecessary conversation with caller and also guest. And mainly this shows going with just like yeah and ok, simply bad. In my point of view, i think that this show was very unprepared show because they don't know how go talk in the show and how we go with show and all other that they don't know about the topic, this was very bad thing. David tried to fun with the female caller and also he didn't give respect much more to her. But both of host David cooper and guest Annie make fun and enjoy with female caller. they talk about Miranda and also they feel about Miranda and peter's ex girlfriend story was very sad. anniee talk about family and sad weird story about affaire. finally, the female caller rate for this show is 3, in my point of view, i rate with 2, i think this was not enough.

The guest Marty Cunnie may have felt undervalued because the caller(s) took so much time. We can have a nice convo duel if Sal comes next time with his girlfriend. From here David and Miranda, from there Sal and Sandra (or whatever his girlfriend's name was, but it definitely wasn't a Hindu name although he said she was Hindu). I wonder why Miranda isn't calling in between the episodes nowadays like she used to do earlier. The first couple caller was all about laughing, especially the lady. She was easy to get humored, given that even David made her laugh so much. Also, learned that the restaurant doesn't really sell the cafilter fish David talks about in intro. Why lie?! Sandeep from India rates this episode 2.5 stars out of 5. There is 0.5 point improvement from last rating because I got to hear some non sexual jokes from David.

Next, he introduce the guest Teresa Taylor, both of them talk about buffalo, this is also non-nonsensical. Their conversation is apart from the topic of the show, so this was a irritating show. Mostly, David cooper said yeah! yeah! in the show when the guest Teresa Taylor talk, that was gives more irritating. And all through the show, they talk about family, personal things and very unnecessary things. The caller Sara is talk like very exciting but she also makes very boring because David cooper tried to make a fun also with the caller Sara, that was totally irritating. I think that this show was totally waste of time, i feel that this show is unprepared show because terese taylor tried to converse something else, that was not a meaningful conversation. Until the end of conversation, they never talk about the topic of this show, that was very non-nonsensical and that was gives a feel like this is unnecessary show.

The earlier one was very bad, with her fighting with a passerby, lets hope for a better one this time. The show kicks off with some random rambling without any cause and reason. Finally after 25 minutes we get a caller, a couple from Canada, who are having some fun on the radio. They seem high and are having a good time. They stay on for a long telling stories and they seem fun to hear. The next caller is Tony, finally after a long long time. And he is back with his typical laugh and he talks quite good and is enjoying life. We get a long talk on Free Masons, US presidents and more. I would suggest my friends to hear this show if they felt\nlike very bore, but I don't like this show. This is Maru from India rating this episode a 2.5 out of 5, 1 of out which is for the return of Tony and his killer laughter. Welcome back Tony, we missed you!",

Someone called and asked to be on the show, and David booked him before he finished his sentence. Some may think it shows David's desperation or lack of guests on the show but I think it shows David appreciation towards his callers and viewers and how David values them. Caller said he was a wannabe stand up comedian too and wanted to discuss it with David.

    "description": "David is talking without the guest in this podcast. He gave COVID-19 instructions to the people as wash your hands often. He played the bad county song for few minutes. After that he spoke with the callers and discussed with england Tony about the quarantine,nature,government,society and all. He played the songs in between to pass the time. I think he don't know how to do the podcast without the guest. Its bad show. The songs make irritating. Again David discussed about the songs,players,relationships,his mom,feelings etc. It feels very bore to hear this podcast. He spoke with the caller about the relationship with the mother. The caller who is a 17 year old girl who changed to boy described their family about how their parents got separated in a sadly manner. But those idiots made fun and laughed. But there is not much reason for laughing. At last David told proud of you to that boy after know her full family story. David told his brother as a gay. David asked useless questions which is not necessary and made it a lengthy conversation. David often use the word \"Fuck\". Then David spoke about his grandfather,job and tried to motivate that boy. Finally David told he became a fan of that boy. But really the story of that boy made me melting. Overall the story make the podcast somewhat better. As usual David made funny jokes which was irritated and remaining was very bored conversations. Mayur from India gives 2 stars for this episode.

    "description": "This show has a correct title no one listening and no one cares. Episode of 155 that is really quite remarkable and successful show. This is really amazing to have young callers as a fan in this show. David cooper really doing well and the caller was so young and shares her boy friend stories to david. But talking in the show with some crap words are new to me. Because we don't use any bad words in the show or in any radio shows. First half an hour with the music and that should be reduced to 5 or ten minutes so that the show duration will be more. Without a guest really makes boredom in the show. Sophie is really innocent and she was spending the time good. I would rate this show as above average and I would suggest this to my friend. Tony I cannot understanding and Keegan is okay. I heard many david shows but this episode doesn't looks good. Callers are really great and they are just talking more than David :) I would rate this show 6 out of 10. I like this show and I will ask my friends to hear this podcast. Iqbal from Pakistan. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

The song Who's Gonna Take the Garbage Out was very heartwarming hearing it after a long time. The First caller Ceasey was nice but sad to hear that she is away from her daughter who is working as a doctor. But she was very funny to say her stories about the funeral thing and after that dating. Nice to hear that David cooks for her girlfriend Miranda. And good to hear about the precaution taken by a 75 year old women starting from social distancing of 6 feet wiping her bags and all. And nice to hear that she is doing Yoga. And it was funny that Miranda texted David that they have been dating for seven years. And the second caller Keygen was too funny. Good to hear that his dad is alive. His story was little bit boring. But once Miranda and Jayjay has entered it was good to hear. The song Excuse me was very nice. Overall a nice talk show nice people. Neo from India rates this episode 6 stars.",

And as its the new normal, David is doing the show from his home and there wouldst be any guest with him tonight and we get a lots of country music. And we get the first song at the very start. The first call is from Jack and Felicia, David's friends. They go on about their life in present times, then another song. The Next caller is Keegan, who weirdly sounds very much like Miranda. Loved the sarcasm David used on the LIzol thing. We next get Alexander and some more guests. Later in the show Tony calls up. And we get to hear his laughter. Later Miranda joins in. Just was thinking Why cant Miranda host this together with David, This is MarU from India, loving these country songs. rating this episode a 3 of 5. Keep going David, your are doing just fine.",

It was so fun to talk about their sex life especially David talking about his ex-girlfriend Mary. But after that the show got really bored as both Jack and Felicia were talking non sense and it really felt like when will their conversation end. It was so relief when the first caller Lucas turned up otherwise it would have been a terrible boring show Shocked to hear David's brother also a gay. The second segment election 2020 was also boring with David got very less to talk. The second caller Keagen started well and fun to hear whenever David talks. The friend of Keagen was also boring to hear. Then Tony called with Miranda and everyone is laugh at Jack. I don't understand anything these weird people are say. Jack is telling us about black history but doesn't want black Tony to talk. Have heard so many David shows and definitely this is the worst one as David got very less space in the show.

    "description": "This episode 159 podcast really entertains the people who looks for entertainment i guess. If someone wants some sleep can hear this show show that they will sleep well, jokes apart. I love David cooper just nail the show alone. If he gets the guest and he will be like a free bird to fly in the sky. All the bad words will be spoken in the broadcast that is the thing is wondering for me. How could someone talk bad words in the public radio podcasts. This show has some mix of boring thing and interesting stuffs and talking about David's Girl Friend Merenda. Sharing the privacy thing is absolutely something new to me. This show is just moving to next level, callers also very sportive about the questions from the David. And we are having a ABBA song off by Merenda. The first song is vou le vou, a song i heard a long time back. Dont know why inspired ABBA to make this song, but its catchy and very singable. Then a typical cat mouse fight between both of them, and we get the song Fernando, and we are still waiting for the first caller of the day. And talk of the devil, its a Keeegan, who has made a new friend. And then Merenda and David play Agony Aunt to Keeegan's problems and they do it seriously for a change. The next caller is Tony form the UK, with a devilish laugh. Wow that's a real sound advice from Tony. This is MarU from India in my point of view I would rate this show with the 4 out of 10. Average podcast show. As I said earlier if someone looks for sleep can hear this show so that they will be having good sleep hearing on this. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]",

You could record between 30 minutes and one hour, but never two hours; that is my point of view. I am sorry. About the songs you have played, it felt like playing random songs from your playlist. David Cooper, my man, I suggest that you may follow a script in order to organize the topics. \"How do you go from annoying to accepttance to david\" in my opnion is a very personal question in a wide broadcast like this. The british guy tony was the funnest part, it was so weard lol. i dont understand keegan at all weird person. And what about the door openning noise lol. Although David to be a littel crazy, he is her girlfriend manager, in his words, off course. Pedro from Brazil rates this episode 3 stars.",

Come on David, understand your friend, it is obvious that there is no way to masturbate for country music, put on a lantine music that your friend goes to heaven. My English friend, your country is famous for fighting violence over football and you have been telling me that the United States is dangerous? The people are protesting for a good reason and this is what I am very proud of. But ok, I'm not going to talk about politcas and be very sincere ... DAVID (yes, upper case because I'm trying to get your attention) you have such a SEXY voice, I really wanted it in my ear before sleeping but how can I not I am satisfied with your podcast (which is more senxual than a lot of Latin music).

    "description": "\"That went well, I think.\"...Um, not quite. Right off the bat, David Cooper annoyed me. The guy just has an annoying voice and the jokes he made were bleh. Andrea, the guest, who has an equally annoying voice, talked about 'plamping', a thing that I never would have thought anyone could possibly care about. In fact, all the topics these two talked about in the first half-hour were either cringe or boring. Ten-year-olds and nudity? Yuck. Cartoon crushes? Both cringe and yawn. What's the weirdest thing you've had inserted? Just stop!!!! David's girlfriend, Miranda came into the conversation and the three of them talked about having not gone to protests for the Black Lives Matter movement, but having 'thrown money at it' by donating. Not really the best thing to say in my opinion. There was generally a lot of flippancy about serious topics throughout the whole show that I didn't really care for. The first caller brought a bit of interest and seriousness to the conversation that David and his guest didn't quite manage to ruin. Florence from Zimbabwe rates this episode 2 stars, and I'm in a generous mood today. Most of the other callers were kind of boring apart from the guy Tony who did the accents and it was hard to want to keep listening, but I'm not a quitter so I stuck with it. I think he was racist but he said he was black so I don't know what to think. Things didn't get that much better throughout. Profanity and constant talk about nudity. The last callers were on drugs and confused me. I wouldn't tune in again.",

The first caller about to go to sleep, and will probably make us go to sleep. Then later we have main cast. Its JayJay, Miranda and the one and only Tony. Whats with David obsession with \"Hemorrhoids\", get over it man. Then we get in some Trump bashing, who continues to surprise everyone with his antics.

Its Keegan, whose smells of pig shit. And we have Miranda, hopefully the show gets on track now. And the hillybilly couple is back.

Who talks about their sex life and reveals disgusting details so openly? Alyssa shared her cult journey, maybe that explains her sexual openness. Her revelation -- Men aren't unfeeling sex machines! Well, thank you. It felt like Alyssa made everybody on the show envious with her talks. But then she revealed something that made me sympathise with her. She peed on another girl. Even during the show she probably peed. All you need to do is ask two girls to pee on each other and apparently they will pee. David hypothesised she had daddy issues. Maybe, but I don't think that covers the whole aspect of it, especially given that she's 34. But she enjoys her life and that's a good thing. Tony is as always a madman.

He has a strong opinion about everything, although he does not believe in any of it. He reminds me of a character in one of Dostoevsky's novels. I agree with Miranda, Atheism makes you more logical and you think you are closer to reality but maybe not. I like religious talks. Lots of religious talks.

She should get someone to write of her sex tales. Then we have a discussion of Drugs. Wow people dont take long to adapt to any solution, an app to check the COVID testing to have sex. Then Miranda joins in. And finally we have a caller, and its Tony. Looks like he is only caller nowadays. Tracy has fully has turned into a full on nymphomaniac. And we also get JJ to the scheme. Tracy thats called being Spiritual. And we get the line of the show \"God is a Tool\", David you should consider titling this for the episode. Love you too Tony. And we hope you didnt mean India Summer. One of ok episodes, with a whole lot of sex, threesomes, drugs etc. The only thing missing was David's obsession with hemorrhoids. This is MarU from India rating this episode of the show a 2.5 of 5. PS: David I understand people spamming you with reviews, and you need to motivate people to write better so atleast give a bonus to the review you select for your site. Also waiting for the Bollywood songs. [Editor's note: we gave MarU a bonus.]",

    "description": "Its the episode 172 of this show and today's guest is Jon Copper, David's brother, who lives in Canada. The typical sibling camaraderie is on display during their initial talk. And we get the 2 callers Dan and Tony being one of them. Then Miranda also joins in. Dan is quite for most of the time. The main discussion of today's episode is David and JJ's upcoming trip to his childhood home in Canada. And Miranda is pissed that she is not invited to it. And Dan and Tony pull David, who has a meltdown over this. We watch both argue over this. And the argument continues post the ogling at Tony's Ex. Davids justification for not inviting Miranda, \"Because of the quarantine\" is reminded me of \"We were on a break\" from FRIENDS. This is MarU from India rating this show a 2.5 of 5. PS: Thanks for the bonus and one question to David, why is there an ad of \"Pornhub Gay\" and it takes to a stupid ad of person showing tongue problems!",

Most of the talk is quite random and does not make any sense to others who are listening. We get an interesting question for David about Miranda, and he doesn't answer it and shy's away from it. We finally get Miranda on the show. The show picks up some pace. \"Hospital Pants\". We are not Asian, we are Indians! Trish is quite generalizing and its not really true.

And David is still in Canada, Allegra leaves quite early and we have Buck, Tony and David only on the show. We get a new type of pizza, called the Mexican Pizza. True detective was quite good. It was quite sad to hear Miranda saying how politics plays out in wearing a mask or not. The best part of the show was when Tony and David started on Miranda's sister.

    "description": "In this episode number 178, from the beginning of the introduction I saw a show garbage coming, especially because of the idea of the companion unuash monette. It is strange that the host begins by saying that the interviewee did not bathe, to further say that he wants to have sex with her, come on, what is that? Who can think of it? That leaves much to be desired and makes the host look like ridiculous, adding the fact that he constantly interrupted the interviewee. And what to say about wanting to have sex with your mother, is a total lack of respect for the moral and Christian values of any society that is respected. This show obviously defends and promotes gay culture and all that. The first guy who called looks like a perfect insane when he talks, it shows that listening to the show a lot has severely affected his mind, that went well, I think. To tell the truth the show deserves that kind of audience due to its mediocre content, it doesn't really surprise me, and the host constantly interrupting, come on, it's unforgivable. Finally, I must say that I do not recommend this show at all, first because of the bad experience when listening to it and second because I consider it a waste of time. A boy named Kevin rates this show with 0 stars, well deserved dude.",

If David as the host of the show never has anything scheduled and doesn't know what to say or do, this idiot Tony knows less. A total disgrace. Talking nonsense things that nobody cares about. The truth is that this episode particularly bothered me much more than the others, not to mention the sounds of the notifications of the guests and the ringtone of the phones, who apparently do not realize the serious lack that results in A radio show, if you can call this shit that. As much Alexander, like David Cooper, like Tony and JJ, and Miranda make the perfect ridiculous in this misnamed radio show. Victor from Maine gave a -500 star rating to this episode.",

Dan and Sara aren't funny, neither is David. When dealing with subjects such as incest, homosexual relations, boat handling, it is clear that they are improvising. The worst of it is that there are people who call the supposed radio show to add even more shit than the hosts have said. This is totally annoying, apparently the callers have nothing else to do and are content to spit out all the shit they have in their little brain. This goes well, I think, because of the fact that the level of the callers is equal to that of the hosts, who show no respect for the callers or themselves, interrupting whenever they can to talk stupid things.

Seriously, why this show is still airing? This is a threat to public health and public mental sanity. Also, David has a fixation on making homophobic jokes. Spoiler, NOT funny. The second funniest joke was when Peter burped. The best joke was when David said he quit his job to try to survive in New York out of this podcast. What is this show about? Does this show even have a structure? Who recommended to talk about those problematic issues when the people participating on the podcast do not know how to joke about those? I hope these questions are never answered to me, cause I do not wanna know nothing about this podcast ever again. Pau from Spain rates this show with a 'please stay away' if you value your time.

Maybe the Christmas season will make him reconsider and improve a little, because at the rate he is going I don't think it will last long to be honest. Around minute 35 David intervenes, saying that the last track of the night is 4 in one and he even gives a phone number to be called, hahaha, nobody has dared to call, which shows that the supposed listeners who call him they are always hired.

And today's is David's last day at this regular work. And for the next 30 minutes or so we hear a lot crap come out of both their mouths and was going nowhere. There is a lot of American Vs Canadian life, it goes on and on. Then we get to everybody's fav Trump, American Education, Jobs, Medicare etc which again goes on for a long time. For North Americans these are good topics for an Indian, have you seen life in India? This is MarU from India rating this show a 2.5 out of 5, An episode with no jokes, but a lot of serious discussions and also no callers today including Tony or Miranda. At 2 hours, its quite long to sit through.",

    "description": "Really 189 th episode of coopers episode ?.oh my good God I cant believe my ears, this show is still on air .I don't understand how he gets guests for his show. By the way who is this Guru? And what do they discuss about for so long? about their jobs. they are talk about davids stupid job he quit. wow it is what we are here to listen. at least I am not interested. hmm David really has the unyoungest brother syndrome or may be lazy haha. guru explains about yoga and grandfather and David too. David never forgets to talk about sex in the show, well that always go well with David at least. guru is a guru in listening I guess. I think both likes Canada too. guru is afraid to tell any bad things about his organization even though David encourages ha ha. To be frank this long talks about job atmosphere is too boring for me ,and I think David has a little less energy in this particular topic may be. Oh so tony is David's only fan aha great. but it is sad to hear that his grandfather had rectal cancer and the caller is amazed to hear gurus name. Anyways please David, please come up with some better topics next time. And here is me Joana from Bahrain rating this show with 3 stars out of 8 ha ha. Better luck next time dude.",

Today's guest is Hannah Marianetti, a friend of Davids and a radio talk show host, i think. After a brief talk, we get a caller, asking for help on Zelda. Then after some more talk, we have Tony calling in. He brings some fun to the conservation. Add to it Jay Jay, after quite many weeks now. With this trio we get the best of David's show and throw in Miranda to it, the show jumps up several notches.  Then we get a lot of talk, on, you guessed it, Donald Trump. The talk goes on long with various topics including dating advice to a 46 years old. This is MarU from India rating this show a 3.5 out of 5, this more of a typical David Cooper show with a lots of cuss words, Tony, JayJay, random callers, This is the kind of episode i would like to listen to, but would be great if it was edited to a smaller duration. And of course we miss Miranda!!",

Good to hear Tony too after a long time. Tony likes radio over TV. He says his life was changed by a book. I would like to know it. David doesn't know whether afterlife concept exists in jewism. I think no such concept exists in jewish religion (thankfully, otherwise imagine same jews reincarnating again and again in this world!). David played a game 'Is it a sin?' and asked various questions. I would like to play this game too. Tell me David, Is it a sin to torture your listeners with 140 minutes of babble? Is it a sin to wonder whether fart is sentient? Is it a sin to produce 191 episodes of This is going well I think? Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 out of 5 stars.",

Oh so cooper met his crazy caller tony David ,really cool. But I don't know really how cooper can talk so endlessly that too something silly for long time. Oh I could not believe my ears that someone really had watched over tony and David cooper. I think David is the only speaker and the comedian guest has nothing much to speak or he may be a bit serious. Why sir sir why? I think tony loves David very much as I felt a strong connection while he called this time. I feel the session went well with David cooper and tony rather than the guest and cooper. But I should also point out that this show is not for children as there are may adults only discussion here .Me Fathima from Bahrain rates this show with 3 stars .",

Finding weird we are almost near 200, that's like 4 years of writing this shit. We get an Q&A's. The pace picked up later when David warmed up to Kollin. Finally after 40 minutes we get a caller, Tony. And later Miranda and Jay Jay also joins in. My two favorite people. Maybe they too sensed the show was going nowhere till they arrived!! Was the Texas caller one of us? That segment needs to improve. No, its was not Bombayish. Then we get a lot of pooping and peeing in the rest of the show. David you turned this show really shitty now with that! An even funnier was Taylor from Texas. This is MarU from India, who's been reviewing this show for past 4 years, rating this show a 3.5 out of 5, one of better ones, the regular gang was bang on!!",

She is still pissed with David over leaving her without saying goodbye! For a really long they reminiscent about their old days. Very soon we get the first caller on the show, The maniac himself, Tony! The only thing we conclude from the episode is David was a A grade shit, sorry make is still a shit (i am just jealous because he has Miranda) and Tony comes back later also. We also have Miranda's ghost which keeps on messaging David every time he says something shitty. So an idea, we have heard a lot of David, as well as Miranda, we would love to hear David's Ex on this show too. This is MarU from India rating this show a 3 out of 5, one of better ones.",

The guest on the show tonight cancelled last minute so we are stuck with Tony. The first discussion is the fiasco over the Meghan Markel - Oprah interview and the ramifications of it. Nice to get a British view of it from Tony. The next topic is David getting a bit down. There are no shitty callers, maybe due the timing going wrong, low wages or also maybe you guys insulting people last time. The first guy to call is called Tomato, from Brazil. And then we continue waiting for a caller. David and Tony are are about to close in the show early and we get a bunch of callers. And then we Taylor with a Kenyan Accent from Texas. And then we have a very long discussion on Meghan Markel Vs British Monarchy. No, 75 cents don't mean a meal for us in Delhi. This is MarU from India rating this show a 2 of 5, need more callers.",

Then after some talk of failed careers, we get the line of the episode, \"Tinder and Linkedin are for networking\" Then we get Tony to the call. David has new prompt for the callers about Sammie's butthole. Its a bit weird., some other prompt will be good. Like ask people to talk in a particular accent or ask them in which position they did it recently. And we get more of these callers.

The topic was why wouldn't we raise by clowns which was quite new to hear. Good to hear everyone over 75 in canada got vaccinated. The call to david's old friend Gallo was very fun to start as david says i am waiting outside your home. And the conversation about their old memories was very good. The call with Anna was fun to hear. The caller haha was so funny when she asked jon wether he is eating real chicken or majic chicken. The call with Tony was also fun to hear.

    "description": "It is unbelievable that a person with so many options who currently has podcasts still insists on wanting to watch David Cooper, a horrible podcast like that, I don't know how it is still on the air. Or another option would be for them to buy the visualization, I think, because it's unbelievable that anyone can spend hours listening to that disturbing David Cooper voice. What I also find funny is David Cooper's insistence on being a presenter, does he care that he sucks at it? that people should go to your program out of penalty or because they are very well paid, are the only alternatives for that to happen rs. However, in this podcast it was presentable but not quite swallowable, what saved the interviewees was Jill Weiner & Dan Linley, who has a very good charisma, but other than that David Cooper is nothing more than a retard, a bad presenter, that's why Joao Victor do Brazil classified this podcast with 2 stars, the other 3 can stick in David Cooper's ass.

She believes in astrology but is willing to defend that belief. I like that. She gets bored by shallow talks and wants to talk about deep things. I wonder how deep those things are. David, despite being a jew, says #FreePalestine. Come on David, you gotta support your people. Maybe as a comedian you can do that support in form of jokes. David talks a lot about incest, shows why he needs therapist. Terry upgraded from caller to friend of David. Someone who religiously listens to this show should be upgraded to title of monk imo. Maybe monks should be made to listen to this show to test their patience and internal stability by their masters. Sandeep from India rates this episode 2.51 out of 5 stars.",

Important thing is not much changed about him. He still talks vulgar, incest and sexual. Sammy is also still the same, jumping house to house and exchanging sex for rent. I personally don't mind the hippie lifestyle but I respect gypsies/banjara more who travel and still earn a living. Miranda calls and appears to be in a solid mood. I like her method of feedback because it has more impact. So David's content was rejected by some show. We are with you David, don't be upset. It is my personal belief that art is never wasted. Even art of this shitshow! I am Sandeep. I am listening to this show from India. I am rating it 3 out of 5 stars. Hoping to have more episodes in future and be shitertained.",
