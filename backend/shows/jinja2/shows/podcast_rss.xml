            <itunes:summary>David is back from sabbath. I can't believe I'm saying this but I missed him. I wonder where he was all this time. Was he stuck in Afghanistan? Important thing is not much changed about him. He still talks vulgar, incest and sexual. Sammy is also still the same, jumping house to house and exchanging sex for rent. I personally don't mind the hippie lifestyle but I respect gypsies/banjara more who travel and still earn a living. Miranda calls and appears to be in a solid mood. I like her method of feedback because it has more impact. So David's content was rejected by some show. We are with you David, don't be upset. It is my personal belief that art is never wasted. Even art of this shitshow! I am Sandeep. I am listening to this show from India. I am rating it 3 out of 5 stars. Hoping to have more episodes in future and be shitertained.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Congrats on 200+ episodes. Goes to show the times we live in. Joker probably wasn't wrong. Natalie is David's former collegemate and fellow comedian. She believes in astrology but is willing to defend that belief. I like that. She gets bored by shallow talks and wants to talk about deep things. I wonder how deep those things are. David, despite being a jew, says #FreePalestine. Come on David, you gotta support your people. Maybe as a comedian you can do that support in form of jokes. David talks a lot about incest, shows why he needs therapist. Terry upgraded from caller to friend of David. Someone who religiously listens to this show should be upgraded to title of monk imo. Maybe monks should be made to listen to this show to test their patience and internal stability by their masters. Sandeep from India rates this episode 2.51 out of 5 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Its really surprising that the show would do 10 let alone 200. Episode 200, a double century of the shit called &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot; and guest tonight is Dan Linley, the first guest of the show and David's friend. . Dan is a bit a low on energy and is a bit subdued. We get a caller in Terry. Dan comes into his own when Miranda's name comes up. They both have a long going feud. and we get the sad news Tony is kinda out of the show, we miss you Tony, join up soon and stay safe. And David is hosting another show. Looks like it will be only these three for the whole show, wish Miranda or Jay Jay pops in soon. And they dont! This is MarU from India, rating this episode a 3.5 of 5. Congrats on your 200th David.</itunes:summary>

And as with David, we get poop questions at the very beginning. And we get next hottest topic, crypto currency, of course David invested in Doge and Cub is a part of the XRP Army. Just look a the new shit ELONGATE, made of Elon Musk's statement. And maybe David should an Airdrop of Doge tokens to his listeners. We get a caller Rocky, or swipe left not sure who it is. The we get into a long winded discussion on Gods, religion etc. Then we come to butt holes, yet another of Davids favorites. This is MarU from India, rating this episode a 3 of 5, i am generous today. Missed the regulars, Tony, Miranda, Jay Jay, but still good one.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>It is unbelievable that a person with so many options who currently has podcasts still insists on wanting to watch David Cooper, a horrible podcast like that, I don't know how it is still on the air. Or another option would be for them to buy the visualization, I think, because it's unbelievable that anyone can spend hours listening to that disturbing David Cooper voice. What I also find funny is David Cooper's insistence on being a presenter, does he care that he sucks at it? that people should go to your program out of penalty or because they are very well paid, are the only alternatives for that to happen rs. However, in this podcast it was presentable but not quite swallowable, what saved the interviewees was Jill Weiner &amp; Dan Linley, who has a very good charisma, but other than that David Cooper is nothing more than a retard, a bad presenter, that's why Joao Victor do Brazil classified this podcast with 2 stars, the other 3 can stick in David Cooper's ass. A hug and a kiss on the mouth David.</itunes:summary>

So if its David, then the talk wouldn't be very far from Drugs, Shit and Sex, not necessarily in that order. Th profound experience David talks about is the Asshole opening up to poop. Then after some talk of failed careers, we get the line of the episode, &quot;Tinder and Linkedin are for networking&quot; Then we get Tony to the call. David has new prompt for the callers about Sammie's butthole. Its a bit weird., some other prompt will be good. Like ask people to talk in a particular accent or ask them in which position they did it recently. And we get more of these callers. This is MarU from India, rating this episode a 2 of 5, i thought Sammie was good, but didn't take it higher.</itunes:summary>

Nice to get a British view of it from Tony. The next topic is David getting a bit down. There are no shitty callers, maybe due the timing going wrong, low wages or also maybe you guys insulting people last time. The first guy to call is called Tomato, from Brazil. And then we continue waiting for a caller. David and Tony are are about to close in the show early and we get a bunch of callers. And then we Taylor with a Kenyan Accent from Texas. And then we have a very long discussion on Meghan Markel Vs British Monarchy. No, 75 cents don't mean a meal for us in Delhi.

            <itunes:summary>Episode 194 with Laura (the Canadian one) on the &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot;. She is a therapist by professions. She is still pissed with David over leaving her without saying goodbye! For a really long they reminiscent about their old days. Very soon we get the first caller on the show, The maniac himself, Tony! The only thing we conclude from the episode is David was a A grade shit, sorry make is still a shit (i am just jealous because he has Miranda) and Tony comes back later also. We also have Miranda's ghost which keeps on messaging David every time he says something shitty. So an idea, we have heard a lot of David, as well as Miranda, we would love to hear David's Ex on this show too. This is MarU from India rating this show a 3 out of 5, one of better ones.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Ok this is Episode 193 of the &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot;. Tonight's guest is Kollin Holtz, who is fellow comedian. Finding weird we are almost near 200, that's like 4 years of writing this shit. We get an Q&amp;A's. The pace picked up later when David warmed up to Kollin. Finally after 40 minutes we get a caller, Tony. And later Miranda and Jay Jay also joins in. My two favorite people. Maybe they too sensed the show was going nowhere till they arrived!! Was the Texas caller one of us? That segment needs to improve. No, its was not Bombayish. Then we get a lot of pooping and peeing in the rest of the show. David you turned this show really shitty now with that! An even funnier was Taylor from Texas. This is MarU from India, who's been reviewing this show for past 4 years, rating this show a 3.5 out of 5, one of better ones, the regular gang was bang on!!</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>I don't know why I feel like smiling hearing David coopers voice. May be because I felt he is kind of funny, but a bit strange too. Oh so cooper met his crazy caller tony David ,really cool. But I don't know really how cooper can talk so endlessly that too something silly for long time. Oh I could not believe my ears that someone really had watched over tony and David cooper. I think David is the only speaker and the comedian guest has nothing much to speak or he may be a bit serious. Why sir sir why? I think tony loves David very much as I felt a strong connection while he called this time. I feel the session went well with David cooper and tony rather than the guest and cooper. But I should also point out that this show is not for children as there are may adults only discussion here .Me Fathima from Bahrain rates this show with 3 stars .</itunes:summary>

Good to hear Tony too after a long time. Tony likes radio over TV. He says his life was changed by a book. I would like to know it. David doesn't know whether afterlife concept exists in jewism. I think no such concept exists in jewish religion (thankfully, otherwise imagine same jews reincarnating again and again in this world!). David played a game 'Is it a sin?' and asked various questions. I would like to play this game too. Tell me David, Is it a sin to torture your listeners with 140 minutes of babble? Is it a sin to wonder whether fart is sentient? Is it a sin to produce 191 episodes of This is going well I think? Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 out of 5 stars.</itunes:summary>

Today's guest is Hannah Marianetti, a friend of Davids and a radio talk show host, i think. After a brief talk, we get a caller, asking for help on Zelda. Then after some more talk, we have Tony calling in. He brings some fun to the conservation. Add to it Jay Jay, after quite many weeks now. With this trio we get the best of David's show and throw in Miranda to it, the show jumps up several notches.  Then we get a lot of talk, on, you guessed it, Donald Trump. The talk goes on long with various topics including dating advice to a 46 years old. This is MarU from India rating this show a 3.5 out of 5, this more of a typical David Cooper show with a lots of cuss words, Tony, JayJay, random callers, This is the kind of episode i would like to listen to, but would be great if it was edited to a smaller duration. And of course we miss Miranda!!</itunes:summary>

By the way who is this Guru? And what do they discuss about for so long? about their jobs. they are talk about davids stupid job he quit. wow it is what we are here to listen. at least I am not interested. hmm David really has the unyoungest brother syndrome or may be lazy haha. guru explains about yoga and grandfather and David too. David never forgets to talk about sex in the show, well that always go well with David at least. guru is a guru in listening I guess. I think both likes Canada too. guru is afraid to tell any bad things about his organization even though David encourages ha ha. To be frank this long talks about job atmosphere is too boring for me ,and I think David has a little less energy in this particular topic may be. Oh so tony is David's only fan aha great. but it is sad to hear that his grandfather had rectal cancer and the caller is amazed to hear gurus name. Anyways please David, please come up with some better topics next time. And here is me Joana from Bahrain rating this show with 3 stars out of 8 ha ha. Better luck next time dude.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Well, this episode is pathetic, apparently no guest wanted to agree to go to that radio show trash, anyway, what he ended up playing is also trash, what ugly music, God, God, God. The truth is not much to say. It is obvious that this program, if it can be called a program, has very little time left. David sucks, as do his guests. Maybe the Christmas season will make him reconsider and improve a little, because at the rate he is going I don't think it will last long to be honest. Around minute 35 David intervenes, saying that the last track of the night is 4 in one and he even gives a phone number to be called, hahaha, nobody has dared to call, which shows that the supposed listeners who call him they are always hired. That highlights the pathetic of this radio show. That is why Juan de Santo Domingo gives it a score of -100 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>In this 185 episode of This is Going Well, I Think. David remembers how people do not like him and that he has a moral problem towards Jews. The main guest Victor Pacheco does not take a fuck out of his mouth, that's all, fuck man, fuck man, fuck man, apparently his brain does not give more to say, just fuck. Then he starts complaining because he booked a show and someone else had also booked and blah blah blah. David as always, celebrating the bad jokes of his guests, giving importance to what does not have it and boasting that he has a gay brother. Victor Pacheco is the same as fuck, fuck, fuck. It seems to me that when he stands on stage the only thing he says to his audience is, fuuck, fuuuck, fuuuuck. And then there's the other jerk who called, the shitty nigga named Tony supposedly from London pouring more shit than the first two already have on them. A man named Tony from London also considers the show to be crap and gave it a -1000 star rating.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>In this podcast you can get stories about cockrings, a really bad 'Ops I did it again' impression, a guy allegedly peeing on a jar during the recording, but also implicit dangerous medical recommendations like using magnesium citrate to lose weight or explicating saying how funny it's mixing anxiolytics with alcohol. Seriously, why this show is still airing? This is a threat to public health and public mental sanity. Also, David has a fixation on making homophobic jokes. Spoiler, NOT funny. The second funniest joke was when Peter burped. The best joke was when David said he quit his job to try to survive in New York out of this podcast. What is this show about? Does this show even have a structure? Who recommended to talk about those problematic issues when the people participating on the podcast do not know how to joke about those? I hope these questions are never answered to me, cause I do not wanna know nothing about this podcast ever again. Pau from Spain rates this show with a 'please stay away' if you value your time. On the other hand, if you are aiming to get fired, I recommend you playing this on your workplace. For the latter situation, it's 5/5 podcast. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

Adelle is joining us from Berlin, Germany after getting stuck there when she went to visit her mother. We get some stories of corona virus near-misses. Later we get some story of David's divorce and his lawyer for it. Most of the talk is on David's move to New York. We get some random talk and arguments. And we don't get any caller for the whole episode. Not even the regulars like Tony or even Miranda. This is quite small episode only only an hour, lesser than the normal 2 hours one. This is Maru from India, rating this episode a below average 2 points out of 5, it was ok and needs to pick on the fun factor.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>To tell the truth the show ends just as it begins, like shit, and to be honest I don't understand what they can call this garbage a radio show. From the beginning it is perceived that it is something improvised, that is, they sat in front of a microphone without knowing what to speak, looking at the clock every second waiting for it to end. Dan and Sara aren't funny, neither is David. When dealing with subjects such as incest, homosexual relations, boat handling, it is clear that they are improvising. The worst of it is that there are people who call the supposed radio show to add even more shit than the hosts have said. This is totally annoying, apparently the callers have nothing else to do and are content to spit out all the shit they have in their little brain. This goes well, I think, because of the fact that the level of the callers is equal to that of the hosts, who show no respect for the callers or themselves, interrupting whenever they can to talk stupid things. Idalia from Mexico rated this show as a trash and gave it only 1 star.</itunes:summary>

His voice is disgusting to tell the truth, it does not convey confidence or desire to continue listening to the nonsense he says. If David as the host of the show never has anything scheduled and doesn't know what to say or do, this idiot Tony knows less. A total disgrace. Talking nonsense things that nobody cares about. The truth is that this episode particularly bothered me much more than the others, not to mention the sounds of the notifications of the guests and the ringtone of the phones, who apparently do not realize the serious lack that results in A radio show, if you can call this shit that. As much Alexander, like David Cooper, like Tony and JJ, and Miranda make the perfect ridiculous in this misnamed radio show. Victor from Maine gave a -500 star rating to this episode.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>In this episode number 178, from the beginning of the introduction I saw a show garbage coming, especially because of the idea of the companion unuash monette. It is strange that the host begins by saying that the interviewee did not bathe, to further say that he wants to have sex with her, come on, what is that? Who can think of it? That leaves much to be desired and makes the host look like ridiculous, adding the fact that he constantly interrupted the interviewee. And what to say about wanting to have sex with your mother, is a total lack of respect for the moral and Christian values of any society that is respected. This show obviously defends and promotes gay culture and all that. The first guy who called looks like a perfect insane when he talks, it shows that listening to the show a lot has severely affected his mind, that went well, I think. To tell the truth the show deserves that kind of audience due to its mediocre content, it doesn't really surprise me, and the host constantly interrupting, come on, it's unforgivable. Finally, I must say that I do not recommend this show at all, first because of the bad experience when listening to it and second because I consider it a waste of time. A boy named Kevin rates this show with 0 stars, well deserved dude.</itunes:summary>

So glitch caused David to miss the intro of the Allegra. The first guests we get are some hippies, and we get a long monologue from Allegra. And later we get Tony in the forum and his evil laugh. And David is still in Canada, Allegra leaves quite early and we have Buck, Tony and David only on the show. We get a new type of pizza, called the Mexican Pizza. True detective was quite good. It was quite sad to hear Miranda saying how politics plays out in wearing a mask or not. The best part of the show was when Tony and David started on Miranda's sister. Imagine Miranda and her sister pillow fighting in her pink underwear. This is Maru from India, rating this a show a boring 1.5,</itunes:summary>

Most of the talk is quite random and does not make any sense to others who are listening. We get an interesting question for David about Miranda, and he doesn't answer it and shy's away from it. We finally get Miranda on the show. The show picks up some pace. &quot;Hospital Pants&quot;. We are not Asian, we are Indians! Trish is quite generalizing and its not really true. This is Maru from India, not Asia, rating this episode an average 2.5 point of 5, it was ok and we are missing the regulars.</itunes:summary>

The typical sibling camaraderie is on display during their initial talk. And we get the 2 callers Dan and Tony being one of them. Then Miranda also joins in. Dan is quite for most of the time. The main discussion of today's episode is David and JJ's upcoming trip to his childhood home in Canada. And Miranda is pissed that she is not invited to it. And Dan and Tony pull David, who has a meltdown over this. We watch both argue over this. And the argument continues post the ogling at Tony's Ex. Davids justification for not inviting Miranda, &quot;Because of the quarantine&quot; is reminded me of &quot;We were on a break&quot; from FRIENDS. This is MarU from India rating this show a 2.5 of 5. PS: Thanks for the bonus and one question to David, why is there an ad of &quot;Pornhub Gay&quot; and it takes to a stupid ad of person showing tongue problems!</itunes:summary>

The first 30 minutes we get lots of Tracy's relationships, and a lots of her steamy encounters., in addition to that we have David playing the Agony Aunt. She should get someone to write of her sex tales. Then we have a discussion of Drugs. Wow people dont take long to adapt to any solution, an app to check the COVID testing to have sex. Then Miranda joins in. And finally we have a caller, and its Tony. Looks like he is only caller nowadays. Tracy has fully has turned into a full on nymphomaniac. And we also get JJ to the scheme. Tracy thats called being Spiritual. And we get the line of the show &quot;God is a Tool&quot;, David you should consider titling this for the episode. Love you too Tony. And we hope you didnt mean India Summer. One of ok episodes, with a whole lot of sex, threesomes, drugs etc. The only thing missing was David's obsession with hemorrhoids. This is MarU from India rating this episode of the show a 2.5 of 5. PS: David I understand people spamming you with reviews, and you need to motivate people to write better so atleast give a bonus to the review you select for your site. Also waiting for the Bollywood songs. [Editor's note: we gave MarU a bonus.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>It appears that the great and mighty David Cooper is also hit badly by Corona virus financially. But I believe not. Being jewish, he can never be in loss and will find ways to keep himself in profit, even at the expense of justice and fairness. It is the jewish way. Today's interview is with a guy named James whose first name is Reverend. I love Tony. Brings such a great energy into show. He has a strong opinion about everything, although he does not believe in any of it. He reminds me of a character in one of Dostoevsky's novels. I agree with Miranda, Atheism makes you more logical and you think you are closer to reality but maybe not. I like religious talks. Lots of religious talks. In the world of hypocrisy and doubt, everybody craves honesty and certainty. Time is of essence though, and should be spent wisely. Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 out of 5 stars</itunes:summary>

Today's interview is with a guy named James whose first name is Reverend. I love Tony. Brings such a great energy into show. He has a strong opinion about everything, although he does not believe in any of it. He reminds me of a character in one of Dostoevsky's novels. I agree with Miranda, Atheism makes you more logical and you think you are closer to reality but maybe not. I like religious talks. Lots of religious talks. In the world of hypocrisy and doubt, everybody craves honesty and certainty. Time is of essence though, and should be spent wisely. Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 out of 5 stars</description>

Oops, I think it was another episode by David himself!) I love how the conversation got sexually confusing when the red-haired miranda came on the scene, it is at times like this that the show goes on and starts to do well, I think. YES DAVID, YOU ARE A GREAT SNOB! So, I just got single too and I'm looking for any kind of relationship (human, preferably), could you call me and solve my love life? Unfortunately, I just don't have a boat to match anyone, does it serve something similar to a boat that I can take there in a not-so-clean pond? Guest natasha vinik has horrible skin condition. Finally, Luiz from northeastern Brazil gives this podcast a deserved 3 stars out of 5 (sorry, I'm not here to lie). [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>It's episode 166 and the guest is a nymphomaniac named Alyssa Westerlund. In my language even her name is sexual. Honestly this time I wouldn't blame David for sexual talks in his show. I'm afraid this woman again opened the door I felt David was trying to close. Who talks about their sex life and reveals disgusting details so openly? Alyssa shared her cult journey, maybe that explains her sexual openness. Her revelation -- Men aren't unfeeling sex machines! Well, thank you. It felt like Alyssa made everybody on the show envious with her talks. But then she revealed something that made me sympathise with her. She peed on another girl. Even during the show she probably peed. All you need to do is ask two girls to pee on each other and apparently they will pee. David hypothesised she had daddy issues. Maybe, but I don't think that covers the whole aspect of it, especially given that she's 34. But she enjoys her life and that's a good thing. Tony is as always a madman. Tony says hi to India so hi to Tony. Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 out of 5 stars.</itunes:summary>

The most boring couple to have called on the show. Even David was happy when they were disconnected. Then we a get bunch of country songs. And after 30 minuets we get a caller. Its Keegan, whose smells of pig shit. And we have Miranda, hopefully the show gets on track now. And the hillybilly couple is back. The song &quot;Touch your woman&quot; was quite weird, certainly for today's times. How about playing some Bollywood songs for a change David.

Living at boyfriend's place for free even after breakup. Hates Chinese but gonna live with one because it saves rent. Doesn't have a car but knows how to call a car. Thinks BLM protestors are radicalized by internet. David also believes in conspiracy theory that China, Russia are making these riots happen. A teenage girl called and David made her feel bad - she apologized for not having gossip as spicy as David wanted and had to make an excuse to cut call (leaving cooking gas open - as old as call cutting excuse directory goes. I felt bad for her.) Tony brought new energy. Sandeep from India rates this episode 3.5 out of 5 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>&quot;That went well, I think.&quot;...Um, not quite. Right off the bat, David Cooper annoyed me. The guy just has an annoying voice and the jokes he made were bleh. Andrea, the guest, who has an equally annoying voice, talked about 'plamping', a thing that I never would have thought anyone could possibly care about. In fact, all the topics these two talked about in the first half-hour were either cringe or boring. Ten-year-olds and nudity? Yuck. Cartoon crushes? Both cringe and yawn. What's the weirdest thing you've had inserted? Just stop!!!! David's girlfriend, Miranda came into the conversation and the three of them talked about having not gone to protests for the Black Lives Matter movement, but having 'thrown money at it' by donating. Not really the best thing to say in my opinion. There was generally a lot of flippancy about serious topics throughout the whole show that I didn't really care for. The first caller brought a bit of interest and seriousness to the conversation that David and his guest didn't quite manage to ruin. Florence from Zimbabwe rates this episode 2 stars, and I'm in a generous mood today. Most of the other callers were kind of boring apart from the guy Tony who did the accents and it was hard to want to keep listening, but I'm not a quitter so I stuck with it. I think he was racist but he said he was black so I don't know what to think. Things didn't get that much better throughout. Profanity and constant talk about nudity. The last callers were on drugs and confused me. I wouldn't tune in again.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Man, what a nonsense radio show. First, how do you begin your show saying: the radio show that no one listens? Another point, a two hours radio show is very very long. You could record between 30 minutes and one hour, but never two hours; that is my point of view. I am sorry. About the songs you have played, it felt like playing random songs from your playlist. David Cooper, my man, I suggest that you may follow a script in order to organize the topics. &quot;How do you go from annoying to accepttance to david&quot; in my opnion is a very personal question in a wide broadcast like this. The british guy tony was the funnest part, it was so weard lol. i dont understand keegan at all weird person. And what about the door openning noise lol. Although David to be a littel crazy, he is her girlfriend manager, in his words, off course. Pedro from Brazil rates this episode 3 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>This episode 159 podcast really entertains the people who looks for entertainment i guess. If someone wants some sleep can hear this show show that they will sleep well, jokes apart. I love David cooper just nail the show alone. If he gets the guest and he will be like a free bird to fly in the sky. All the bad words will be spoken in the broadcast that is the thing is wondering for me. How could someone talk bad words in the public radio podcasts. This show has some mix of boring thing and interesting stuffs and talking about David's Girl Friend Merenda. Sharing the privacy thing is absolutely something new to me. This show is just moving to next level, callers also very sportive about the questions from the David. And we are having a ABBA song off by Merenda. The first song is vou le vou, a song i heard a long time back. Dont know why inspired ABBA to make this song, but its catchy and very singable. Then a typical cat mouse fight between both of them, and we get the song Fernando, and we are still waiting for the first caller of the day. And talk of the devil, its a Keeegan, who has made a new friend. And then Merenda and David play Agony Aunt to Keeegan's problems and they do it seriously for a change. The next caller is Tony form the UK, with a devilish laugh. Wow that's a real sound advice from Tony. This is MarU from India in my point of view I would rate this show with the 4 out of 10. Average podcast show. As I said earlier if someone looks for sleep can hear this show so that they will be having good sleep hearing on this. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>This particular show was different as starting with Jack and Felicia acted as the Host and David as the guest and the conversation between them telling about their weekend was good to start the program. It was so fun to talk about their sex life especially David talking about his ex-girlfriend Mary. But after that the show got really bored as both Jack and Felicia were talking non sense and it really felt like when will their conversation end. It was so relief when the first caller Lucas turned up otherwise it would have been a terrible boring show Shocked to hear David's brother also a gay. The second segment election 2020 was also boring with David got very less to talk. The second caller Keagen started well and fun to hear whenever David talks. The friend of Keagen was also boring to hear. Then Tony called with Miranda and everyone is laugh at Jack. I don't understand anything these weird people are say. Jack is telling us about black history but doesn't want black Tony to talk. Have heard so many David shows and definitely this is the worst one as David got very less space in the show. Neo from India rates this a 2 star.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>It was a new experience where there is no guest and David Cooper was full on .The show starts off with a nice track. The song Who's Gonna Take the Garbage Out was very heartwarming hearing it after a long time. The First caller Ceasey was nice but sad to hear that she is away from her daughter who is working as a doctor. But she was very funny to say her stories about the funeral thing and after that dating. Nice to hear that David cooks for her girlfriend Miranda. And good to hear about the precaution taken by a 75 year old women starting from social distancing of 6 feet wiping her bags and all. And nice to hear that she is doing Yoga. And it was funny that Miranda texted David that they have been dating for seven years. And the second caller Keygen was too funny. Good to hear that his dad is alive. His story was little bit boring. But once Miranda and Jayjay has entered it was good to hear. The song Excuse me was very nice. Overall a nice talk show nice people. Neo from India rates this episode 6 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>This show has a correct title no one listening and no one cares. Episode of 155 that is really quite remarkable and successful show. This is really amazing to have young callers as a fan in this show. David cooper really doing well and the caller was so young and shares her boy friend stories to david. But talking in the show with some crap words are new to me. Because we don't use any bad words in the show or in any radio shows. First half an hour with the music and that should be reduced to 5 or ten minutes so that the show duration will be more. Without a guest really makes boredom in the show. Sophie is really innocent and she was spending the time good. I would rate this show as above average and I would suggest this to my friend. Tony I cannot understanding and Keegan is okay. I heard many david shows but this episode doesn't looks good. Callers are really great and they are just talking more than David :) I would rate this show 6 out of 10. I like this show and I will ask my friends to hear this podcast. Iqbal from Pakistan. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>David is talking without the guest in this podcast. He gave COVID-19 instructions to the people as wash your hands often. He played the bad county song for few minutes. After that he spoke with the callers and discussed with england Tony about the quarantine,nature,government,society and all. He played the songs in between to pass the time. I think he don't know how to do the podcast without the guest. Its bad show. The songs make irritating. Again David discussed about the songs,players,relationships,his mom,feelings etc. It feels very bore to hear this podcast. He spoke with the caller about the relationship with the mother. The caller who is a 17 year old girl who changed to boy described their family about how their parents got separated in a sadly manner. But those idiots made fun and laughed. But there is not much reason for laughing. At last David told proud of you to that boy after know her full family story. David told his brother as a gay. David asked useless questions which is not necessary and made it a lengthy conversation. David often use the word &quot;Fuck&quot;. Then David spoke about his grandfather,job and tried to motivate that boy. Finally David told he became a fan of that boy. But really the story of that boy made me melting. Overall the story make the podcast somewhat better. As usual David made funny jokes which was irritated and remaining was very bored conversations. Mayur from India gives 2 stars for this episode.

David operating from his apartment due to Corona virus shutdown in San Francisco. JJ is a neighbor of David is a musician by profession. After the intro we are heading nowhere. The first caller is Miranda, who looks like will be the only caller tonight. The next caller is Tony from England. Quite a surprise to hear him calling. Tony an aeronautical engineer, quite a big surprise again. We get some good banter. Wow we get another view of Tony today, with him doing some thing for the world. Corona dominates the show tonight. JJ then plays a song on his guitar. It is a good one. This is one of better shows in these times. And this is Maru from India rating a 3 of 5 for this episode.

In this episode, David looks very sad. The caller is very too much talking and I don't know which are laughing very bad man. Sometimes the caller is engaging all around.

            <itunes:summary>On the eve to 150th episode we have guest named Bobzilla who wears his wife's ex-husband's jewelry. Bob and David discuss spouse's shitting frequency, coronavirus, maslov's hierarchy and variety of other things. I liked the moment where David used a logical intricacy to detect fallacy in Bob's argument. It is a sign of intelligence. Someone called and asked to be on the show, and David booked him before he finished his sentence. Some may think it shows David's desperation or lack of guests on the show but I think it shows David appreciation towards his callers and viewers and how David values them. Caller said he was a wannabe stand up comedian too and wanted to discuss it with David. I thought he was just trying to appease but maybe he was genuine because his joke level was even worse than David's. Sandeep from India rates this episode 2.5 out of 5 stars. PS: We all support Bob's demand for plus sized underwear for men.</itunes:summary>

The first caller is Fizal and is high on pain killers on a broken leg. I don'T think he likes any jews. Dan is real good cracking jokes without any effort. We then get into a name guessing game. He and David make a good team. The return of Tony continues and he is back with his laugh and profanities. Mae is good fun and T.J. starts to get into his groove soon, taking offence of some of Mae's choice of words. Hoping to hear more of his. Next is Miranda, and she gets into a fight with Dan. Wow, what an episode! This is MarU from India rating this a 3 out of 5, it was fun and one of better recent episodes. Finally a good episode after a long time.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Its 145th episode of the &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot; and the guest tonight is a repeat offender, Alyssa Westerlund. The earlier one was very bad, with her fighting with a passerby, lets hope for a better one this time. The show kicks off with some random rambling without any cause and reason. Finally after 25 minutes we get a caller, a couple from Canada, who are having some fun on the radio. They seem high and are having a good time. They stay on for a long telling stories and they seem fun to hear. The next caller is Tony, finally after a long long time. And he is back with his typical laugh and he talks quite good and is enjoying life. We get a long talk on Free Masons, US presidents and more. I would suggest my friends to hear this show if they felt
like very bore, but I don't like this show. This is Maru from India rating this episode a 2.5 out of 5, 1 of out which is for the return of Tony and his killer laughter. Welcome back Tony, we missed you!</itunes:summary>

like very bore, but I don't like this show. This is Maru from India rating this episode a 2.5 out of 5, 1 of out which is for the return of Tony and his killer laughter. Welcome back Tony, we missed you!</description>

            <itunes:summary>David cooper is the host of this episode, in the introduction he talk very unnecessary things like I don't care about anyone and talk about coffee, i think that this was unnecessary. Next, he introduce the guest Teresa Taylor, both of them talk about buffalo, this is also non-nonsensical. Their conversation is apart from the topic of the show, so this was a irritating show. Mostly, David cooper said yeah! yeah! in the show when the guest Teresa Taylor talk, that was gives more irritating. And all through the show, they talk about family, personal things and very unnecessary things. The caller Sara is talk like very exciting but she also makes very boring because David cooper tried to make a fun also with the caller Sara, that was totally irritating. I think that this show was totally waste of time, i feel that this show is unprepared show because terese taylor tried to converse something else, that was not a meaningful conversation. Until the end of conversation, they never talk about the topic of this show, that was very non-nonsensical and that was gives a feel like this is unnecessary show. Overall, I don't like this whole podcast, the first caller rates this podcast with 4 star but I rate this podcast with 1 star, I don't like this whole podcast.

            <itunes:summary>What? .pizza domain name costs more than .com? I liked the caller Sal from Bangladesh (as did everybody else). Wish he call in future episodes as well. The guest Marty Cunnie may have felt undervalued because the caller(s) took so much time. We can have a nice convo duel if Sal comes next time with his girlfriend. From here David and Miranda, from there Sal and Sandra (or whatever his girlfriend's name was, but it definitely wasn't a Hindu name although he said she was Hindu). I wonder why Miranda isn't calling in between the episodes nowadays like she used to do earlier. The first couple caller was all about laughing, especially the lady. She was easy to get humored, given that even David made her laugh so much. Also, learned that the restaurant doesn't really sell the cafilter fish David talks about in intro. Why lie?! Sandeep from India rates this episode 2.5 stars out of 5. There is 0.5 point improvement from last rating because I got to hear some non sexual jokes from David. Even if they were bad, at least it's a start.</itunes:summary>

In my point of view, i think that this show was very unprepared show because they don't know how go talk in the show and how we go with show and all other that they don't know about the topic, this was very bad thing. David tried to fun with the female caller and also he didn't give respect much more to her. But both of host David cooper and guest Annie make fun and enjoy with female caller. they talk about Miranda and also they feel about Miranda and peter's ex girlfriend story was very sad. anniee talk about family and sad weird story about affaire. finally, the female caller rate for this show is 3, in my point of view, i rate with 2, i think this was not enough.

            <itunes:summary>Boring episode, probably because of somewhat boring callers. &quot;Future ex-wife&quot;, nice phrase used by David, heard it first time. Another nice phrase was by a caller calling for having a &quot;2020 vision&quot; for next year. Nothing much to remember from the episode. Oh, and David Cooper officially called this show a PODCAST! He specifically said it is a podcast, not a radio show. Then why in the hell does his website jew.pizza keep reminding us in the face that it's NOT a podcast? Explain this contradiction!! I like the callers though. They seem to be simple, down to earth people. We internet people tend to forget all these things in our hypocritical social circle. This show happening in a physical coffee shop, letting people call from outside phone booth, broadcasting on radio, and letting people do phone calls.. all these things seem to bring a sense of old tradition, and with it the groundedness. Although David himself, like me, is pretty hypocritical, but it seems he craves honesty, groundedness, interacting with down to earth people. And that's why he made this show this way. Sandeep from India rates this episode 2 out of 5 stars. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>God, this David Copper guy sounds like he is eating a shoe while dancing lambada. How did this guy think he could have a podcast? I don't know if he sounds worse when his pitch is going up and down, all uncontrolled, like a bunch of cool cats playing jazz, or when he tries to sound like professional radio and the attempt is just laughable. His co-host, Tracy, is not any better, repeating exact lines the same as he said them for no reason but waste the listener's time. The notion that some podcasters have - and a lot of the media, sadly - that everyone's opinion on politics is relevant is one of the greatest plagues on our culture. I literally have no idea who would want or care to hear about what some random thinks about politics. They should stick to their jokes - I mean, after learning to actually make them funny. Between the completely meaningless political commentary, and the awful jokes, I think the rest went well. Except of course there was nothing else besides that, and the show is unbearable. If this show had 2 minutes, it might be bearable albeit useless. To listen to this for two hours should be enough to be paid a nice amount of money, and even then it would be torture. This gets a zero from Takashi from Hawaii. Infinitely prefer Dr. Pepper to David Cooper. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

Funny thing happened, at some point the host and his guest Sequoia talk about weird domain names and that's when I realised that I too was one of those fools who didn't believe that the website was real. I have been through many episodes up until now. I always thought it was a running joke of the show. I checked the site out for real this time, well what do you know it exists. I think David needs to announce that it is real website. Here I was thinking that David is a bit anti-semitic or thinks that jew are too fat. Sorry David! This episode was refreshing, especially because of the guest. The show started with David's usual intro. I know he's done it 138 times but damn that intro sounds like it is pre-recorded. I wonder if he practices it in front of the mirror before sleeping. The guest was also a radio show host. It felt so weird. At some points you wonder who really is the host of the running show. Sequoia definitely gave Cooper a run for his money. Sequoia has been doing it for a longer time and it shows. I hope Sequoia gave some pointers to David and that he uses it to better this atrocity.

David tells his house is smelly as he leaks urine.oh really? nasty. the guest tells she was in jail too .weird experiences she shares.he then continues to talk about nothing,who knows what he has in his mind.Then two callers came a woman and man,they talk something and goes, David asks about tony and suggests Celeste to take a day off and spend some time at the coffee shop.She then agrees as this thought went well with her,even though she has to adjust her schedules.She then tells again about drinking and driving and about DUI classes or something.David was curious as he asks about educational classes.Oh boy ,David is curious to learn,right?Then a man calls and asks about gravity,wow.makes no sense.David himself praises and tells what a show,great man.Then a man named Parker Newman calls and tells he is partially Jewish.

            <itunes:summary>A much more energetic episode than last few ones. Looked like everybody got their energy and enthusiasm back, the host, the guest and the callers. But what does that mean in case of the great host of this great show David Cooper? It means more vulgarity, more profanity and more bad jokes. It appears that David is beginning to carve out his space, because now callers appear to match David's level. They have begun to share and reciprocate David's passion and personality of being bad. Not evil type of bad but poor type of bad, like not bad boys but bad song or bad vegetable. So, with David at center, the whole environment becomes like that - the guests, the callers, even the viewers- like me. So yeah, being in that mindset and still under influence, I, Sandeep from India, rate this episode 4 out of 5 stars for bringing the bad back.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>In this episode there are two people. Roberto and Kelsey are a couple. David asks them how they met. Turns out they met through Tinder. After that David asks a lot of question on their meeting and relationship, including asking them to perform a sexual act live on show. A gay person or group called and David tells them a personal bathroom selfie story. After that David again makes the couple resume their dating story. It seems he is quite interested in it. Even asked about actual sex talks and both of them were easily giving details with gentital. Guess that's contrast between western and eastern culture for me right there. David gave a nice creative name to this episode: &quot;Roberto's awakening and Kelesey's camping trip&quot;, based on their date. Sandeep from India is giving this episode 3 and a half star out of 5 because there was an actual real story to listen to instead of very bad empty talks that usually happen.</itunes:summary>

The first caller is Miranda, David's girl friend. I wish she was the host of the show and David the Guest. The three go on to have a long discussion on a variety of things. David and Miranda go over the questions they have prepared for her. No callers today and it was good, as David used to lose interest in them quite soon. Andrea is easy to listen to and the compatibility between the two is quite evident. Hoping we get to hear more of her. This Karti from India rating this episode a 3 out of 5, a big improvement over past few weeks.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>I just listened to the podcast titled &quot;This is going well, I think by David Cooper&quot;. It is apparently the 130rd episode, I am surprised it's been going on so long given the type of conversations they have. David is ruthless with the people he interviews. He is invasive, childish and sometimes funny. Although these factors don't necessarily make him a bad interviewer. He goes in so deep that you can see the person who he is interviewing bare which makes them more relatable and easy to feel for. One of the guests of the day was Monica, after listening to her talk. I feel inspired by her character just by knowing that she came on the show given all her insecurities. Her story about the tattoo which symbolises not always being able to succeed was something new and refreshing. I personally didn't like the second guest as much. I also noticed that Monica stopped talking as much after the second guest came in, probably because of her being socially incompetent like she discussed. Annick Adelle from what I gather is a lesbian who kinda hates many things like men, balls with hair and apparently jews. She seems very open and very outgoing which is the opposite of Monica. So it felt like the chemistry was off, it would have been way better if it was done separately. All in all I think that went well. Chris from India rates this show 4 stars out of 5. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

Its the 129th episode starring as guest is Victor Trevino, a fellow comedian and unknown to David. The start is off to some random rambling about ages and adults and it goes on and on. Finally a caller, the first caller, is Miranda, David's girlfriend and we get another Alegra, a professional clown, Then we get some poop stories, next we get a Bolivian caller, who kicks off a discussion on dictators. The show sounds very long and really gets boring in the middle, it never picks up after a flat start. The guest is quite boring and show requires someone exciting and interesting to pick off from. The show picks up a bit after Miranda drops by after her pooping. This is Karti from India, rating this episode an 1.5 out of 5 stars, easily one of the most boring episodes.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Its Episode 128 and the host today at the &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot; show is Alyssa Westerlund, about David doesn't know much. The first caller is a couple and Alyssa takes a linking to the girl. The conversion goes on a wired line with all the fungus talk. The next receiver, Ellen, hates ritual coffee and we get a next caller is Miranda, Davids girlfriend. If i thought David uses too many cuss words, just listen to Alyssa and your ears will bleed. She goes on to tell a story of how she fired her therapist over a small issue. The conversation goes nowhere all through the show. She also got into an argument with a passerby. It was like she was minutes away from a nervous breakdown. It was borderline bizarre. Even David had to apologize to her, dont know why. This is Karti from India rating this episode a 1.5 out of 5, not a typical David episode, and it was really weird one.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>David cooper host the show as usual with fire and I like his show. Even though he didn't have more listeners, he will not down. David plays his role well. I think both the hosts were not prepared for the show, they simply chat with the callers. This show need some gaming concept so that it might reach more listeners and it will be more interesting. I never seen a show like this very slow. Callers talked about the animal love and david didn't like animals and the caller was not happy with the answer. She wants everyone to love animals. Only pet animals can be loved. Discussing about the cancer patient and it is making some what very sad and it is not happy to hear about it. David was very energetic through out the show. They didn't leave any break. Thump up for their energy level. I need some what concepts so that the radio show will be reached more numbers of people. I would rate 2 star for this show. It is my personal opinion. I am Sunnhil.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>The show begins with David Cooper introducing his show &quot;This is going well, I think&quot; and after listening to it i feel like that it did indeed go well or at-least i think it did. The show seems quite casual, sometimes a little bit too causal that it almost seems downright unprofessional. The topics were all over the place some funny, some were personal, some cringe-worthy and some outright inappropriate. I am just glad atleast out of the two speaker David and Willie (The famous guy from Reebok ad/the show's guest), Willie actually confronted David Cooper when he went overboard. Some remarks were disrespectful and inappropriate (retards, mom's vaginas). The callers were interesting my favourite one was the woman who didn't give her name, she called when they were speaking about Willie stealing a bowling ball; I think it brought out the best of both the speakers and they were very comfortable discussing it and cracking jokes. David sometimes made medical jokes which i think most audience would not get but could be very enjoyable for some people in the field, like me. I think it'd be great if David learnt to shut his trap once in a while like when Willie was talking about Tim Olsen &quot;Tim Olsen, you fish killer!&quot;, That was golden; needed to be continued. Though unprofessional its smoothness and continuity made me like it. The show ends on a fungal note. Chris Maxwell from India rates this episode that went well 4 stars. Good Show. Time for some meditation.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>This is probably one of the longest running train wrecks out there - I'm not sure if I would've put my money on it, but here we are. Cooper has his comedian friend David Roth in the guest seat, again. Things get off the block with the first caller for the evening before we are taken for a little, not-so rehashing walk down the Cooper-Roth friendship lane. Roth then proceeds to shed some light on his comedic apprehensions and challenges, which I thought was quite insightful. And that bit about jew.pizza and the oven - that was some connection to come up with! About half way in, we get someone from the other side of the glass posing The question: what's the premise of the show? For a second, I thought Cooper was going to take the bait but he chose the admirable dodge. And talking about our missing man from across the pond, it's almost eerie to not hear the bloke laugh. Oh well! An Austrian woman then rings in from the street and I thought she suddenly put some life into the episode. Some of the callers who followed her were quite funny too. And that Mariano character, what does he smoke? He's psychotic. Moving on, looks like Roth has some interesting shows coming up. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with 4 stars - not so rennet-free but still very much edible, I think.</itunes:summary>

David told Rachel as you are the good human being because he told i didn't see the body. They both talk to Dan as if you are get pregnant do abortion. Then get pregnant with constipation and going to become a mom. Three had fun together and laughing. A caller called, David thought he was drunk and made some funny comments but it turned out the caller had mental disability and David felt really bad after that. Well, repenting is the path of forgiveness, which is exactly what the next caller pointed out who was a nurse. They discuss about Dan family. He attended the phone call and do bad jokes. Overall it is very irritating to hear. They talked about sex very often. Dan talked about her interests in sex,movies and discuss about producer. They discuss the website go to match.com.

            <itunes:summary>One of the better episodes of this show, mainly because there were some honest talks. Ray Connolly is an advertising freelancer who clearly isn't satisfied with his current work and wants to do music. Interestingly David also plays music which is good to know. I came to know that David does standup comedy too. What I found interesting was their talk about therapists. Ray was either high or depressed (or both. But not saying it in negative way.) Not many callers today. David revealed he was 32, but to be frank he doesn't sound 30+. He appears like someone in early or middle twenties, at least from voice. In this episode it felt like David was restraining himself, which is a change because he generally otherwise goes haywire with the flow. Sandeep from India rates this episode 3 stars, which is surprising for me too because I should've given higher. I guess I missed David's original style, even though it is full of profanities and vulgar talks. He has spoiled me.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>As if one wasn't enough, now we have two guests in Episode 117 of David Cooper's Famous show about which the only thing going good is its name. Jack and Felicia talk a lot about their life, especially Felicia who talks a lot about her sister. David's camera or microphone broke during the show, so I guess he will have to do a dozen more episodes of this show to just make up for that. In this show people just talk and talk, content is of little to no importance. No one can finish his sentence before being interrupted. No line of thought is ever taken forward without its core content being changed from one to who knows what. I'm not sure if Felicia has naturally such annoying voice or she did it just for this show. Sandeep from India rates this episode 4 stars because it has changed my default setting for things that used to annoy me and set the bar really low.</itunes:summary>

And then the show turns into a full fledged music show!!! Finally another caller, Miranda, the saving grace. We get back boobs and ass, typical of the show. Molly calls in and describe the Tik-Tok app. And Claine is back, and we another round of music talk. The next caller are a couple Jack and Felicia. Then we have Miranda back, claiming the joke. This is Karti from India rating this show a 2 out 5, something different today. A lot of random incoherent conversations, which lead nowhere.</itunes:summary>

And very soon we get the first caller on the show and we get the reason as why we are receiving so many calls recently, the phone booth outside the studio. We get a long conversation as they go on reminiscing over their last show. They call David's mom. The next caller is Mark Kenso, who hangs up very quickly. The show was going downhill eating Anchovies and Jessi calls in. We have a boring talk on guitars. They go on to call Atish's wife Meetu, who was sleeping and goes back to sleep again when David pops in the poop show. Then Miranda calls in, i wish she hosted the show, she is so much better at it. Even an indian guest like me is awful. This Karti from India rating this episode a 1.5 out of 5. For most parts it was quite boring, better get some interesting guests.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Episode 112 of &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot;. Today's guest on the show is Donkey show, a circus acrobat and later she started teaching it. Very soon we have the first caller of the show, Ali. And we loose her quite soon. The next caller is also gone soon enough. We have a new segment on the show and its funny, finally in the show something to laugh about. Then they go on to call David's mom, whose doesn't receive the call, so they leave a message. The domain name part really cracked me up. Davids mom calls up later but it doesn't get weird. We get a brief insight in Davids earlier life. The show is missing its regular guest, Tony, who has been missing from the show for recent few episodes. This is Karti from India rating this episode with a 2 star, an okay episode, thanks to Miranda finally calling in.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>This show is really humorous and they doesn't have any limit to talk about each other, telling about the host and the Guest. They are having fun and recording in coffee shop. This show is really good time pass and they talked about the students of the guest. They talked about the wild animals in the zoo and the school picnic. David host the program with some great questions and he makes this show rocking. They talked about some topics with the callers. callers had some great fun. I'm really surprised to hear this kind of show in radio show. But this is really unique and it is good to hear about it. They talked about trump supporters. Talked about time travelers. Talked about the poop and hand wash. David likes to sneeze more and when the sun hits him he likes to sneeze. After sneezing when the liquid smells odd and then it is bad breathe problems. Strong sense of character and they feel like they did a great and very funny show. My name is Paquee from Pakistan and I rate this show 3.5 stars!</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>110th episode of 'That went well, I think' with a guest woman named Erica W. She's also a jew. A jew meets a jew, what a delight! Erica wants every man to have desire of dating her and is disappointed that she has never been sent a dick pic. The episode is full of profanities. It seems David Cooper only know one form of comedy, that is sexual or vulgar comedy. If you want to break up with your boyfriend, call this show because David will manage to do that. He will tell you hidden desires of your boyfriend, without even speaking to him, that will make you vomit. I'm glad the couple that called in this episode hung up before they reached that stage. I pray for their quick recovery for the trauma they sustained by talking to David. And for the trauma these 3 hours of listening to this show caused me, I will call this show a podcast, because I know that pisses David off. Sandeep from India is rating this show 4 stars for teaching me new vulgarities and showing me new depths to which humans are capable of falling. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

We start off with the typical D-M banter. They go on to answer some questions by Vic. Elon Musk, you need to hear Miranda's views on the Tesla design. They go on to reminiscent their first date, first event. We get the first caller and its Tony and no, I am not on the David's lousy payroll. And yes I love Miranda :) Tony has certainly piqued my interest on the The Abduction. They go on to discuss David's ex-wife. After Tony, they go on to discuss an almost threesome. They return to Vic's questions. We get an argument and then an awkward silence and David pouring his heart out over his relapse into drug addiction. Come on Drugs, not cool. Then its back to Vic's questions. Till we get the next caller, Frankie, who was on a date, Miace, who give us good couple Made-for-each-other story. With Miranda in the house sparks were bound to fly, but not the type we witnessed. One of best shows episodes and had really heartfelt moments.

She is clearly a post wall woman who still wants to appear hot and desirable to guys. I feel sorry for the callers. First guy called and she pretty much made herself his girlfriend or at least a date while the guy had little to no interest in her. Second caller was a catholic and was forced to hung up with discussions of arse and sh*t. The most cringe-worthy moment was when David was talking about masturbating next to his mother and Pamela started moaning and David shut her up. Even Miranda, David's girlfriend, called in between the show and literally told her to shut up. Eww, must have hit hard on the woman. Didn't go well for her I guess. Sandeep from India rates this show 3 star. Three star because it's one those &quot;so bad they're good.&quot; [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

They are going to start a new podcast. They have their friends call up on the show and we have four of their friends call up in quick succession, one of them named Susan Butt who tries to hook in with Roberto. That was the boring part. The shows starts to kick in when Tony calls up, who sounds a bit subdued but is still fun. Later we have Miranda call in and the fun begins. The conversation between David and Miranda are the best part of the show. I enjoy them the most. Better get new/interesting guest on the sow or it will continue downhill. This is Karti from India rating this episode a three out of five. One of better shows.</itunes:summary>

They are going to start a new podcast. They have their friends call up on the show and we have four of their friends call up in quick succession, one of them named Susan Butt who tries to hook in with Roberto. That was the boring part. The shows starts to kick in when Tony calls up, who sounds a bit subdued but is still fun. Later we have Miranda call in and the fun begins. The conversation between David and Miranda are the best part of the show. I enjoy them the most. Better get new/interesting guest on the sow or it will continue downhill. This is Karti from India rating this episode a three out of five. One of better shows.</description>

The first caller on the show is some lady who was in some show and goes on blabbering about some guy. The next caller is a Daniel and seems quite interested in the jew pizza. They go on to read some texts form someone named Vic. They go on with their boring chat till Tony calls in. He is easily the star of the show after Miranda. Its good to hear Tony's voice after a long time. Happy birthday Tony!! The final part starring Miranda lights up the show. She is the easily the best part of the show. David please call Miranda as a guest and throw in Tony in the mix, it will be really crazy. If you like pornography, the end of this show is for you!

Well congratulation for 101 episodes of this show, and thanks to Guest: Sam Chown of Shmu. This is a good person for this show. I did not understand the basic topic of this show, but i liked the conversation between. I am congratulated to Sam Chown for his new music album name I guess &quot;shume&quot;. I like the conversation between David and his father. David disturbed his father in late night. Sam chown is don't believed in god and he was a religious or not I don't care. There was some bad thing happen when the first caller Miranda is calling but David is not received her call, this is a very bad manner, Mr. David Cooper. I am surprised that there is no any caller to call on this show. I think the good part of this conversation is a political discussion. So, The whole podcast is good and this time there is no any bad word I recognized, I am sunil from India giving 3 stars to this podcast. This is a good radio show. Thanks.

            <itunes:summary>This Radio show is really funny and It sounds boring and losing the interest. Cooper just talks to the Krista and it's really funny. Krista came from Auckland. She is struggling to make money for her needs. They both talked about the relationship and they talked about the sex. Also they talked very funny, Caller talked but that's also very boring. Caller said some word about the word in his T-shirt. They talked about their boring life. Caller was returning to home after the work. David just said that Krista is very dirty. But krista said that her mom praised about her cleanliness. Half of the show David telling that the Krista is dirty really funny. 2nd caller is really interesting and she shared about her life things. Good story will be rewarded with the original poster. Really funny. Fucking Jesus christ is the Only word keep on repeating from David. It's really pathetic show and this audio will be really a crap and wasting a time in your life by hearing this. Once you heard this audio you will feel very funny and you will be getting the time waste. 4th caller story is really boring. If you need to waste the time please hear it otherwise leave this crap. Tony calls and he is strange to understand. I am Aditya from India and I rate this show three out of five stars.</itunes:summary>

Today's guest on Thanksgiving is Dan Linley. We get the first joke with &quot;Oral Herpes&quot;. The first caller is Sarah from a band. They go one to have a long conversation. The next caller is Donald, a doctor. And also Miranda calls up. The next caller is Vic, whose girlfriend left him car. The next couple is quite boring. The show drags on till Tony arrives and all hell breaks loose. We get all the cusses and profanities (boobs, Tits, Vaginas) which were missing in the past few episodes. Tony met David in Ireland on his recent trip. The discussion between Dan and Tony is hilarious. I enjoyed this episode, a nice way to end the week. This is Karti from India rating it a three out of five.</itunes:summary>

The show drags on till Tony arrives and all hell breaks loose. We get all the cusses and profanities (boobs, Tits, Vaginas) which were missing in the past few episodes. Tony met David in Ireland on his recent trip. The discussion between Dan and Tony is hilarious. I enjoyed this episode, a nice way to end the week. This is Karti from India rating it a three out of five.</description>

            <itunes:summary>Episode Ninety Six of the show called as &quot;This Is Going Well, I Think with David Cooper&quot;. The location has been changed to Isle of Man for todays show. Today's guest on the show is Ben Savoury, who according to the host wondering why is he here. The show starts on a boring note, we come to know that Ben was earlier in broadcasting. Fifteen minutes into the show i am bored out of mind, hearing cat stories is making me kill me. The guest has very soft voice and that helped me sleep. Till we get a caller, its Miranda, one of my favorites. Finally we get some traction in the show. Then Miranda goes on bore us with questions for Ben. The shows gets going when Tony comes on the record. Frankly the show is going downhill with every episode. This is Karti from India rating this particular episode a 2 out of 5. I still have hope it will pickup.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>The 95th episode opens well with the guest introducing her as powerful comedian and the original age was revealed and there is some fussy things happen between guest and host David and the first caller enters the show. The guest is open to new experience and the conversation runs around age and enters into the co artist of the guest as comedian. There is a healthy conversation between them and she said on her 30th birthday happenings about her day and the pizza shop and the conversation went over .And lot of background noise is also there and conversation runs on cbd. The gay topic conversation doesn't went well and it's awkward and overall the word &quot;fuck&quot; is mostly used all over the show. There is no particular topic in this conversation but here and there pizza shop was discussed. The yawning sound of the host towards the end of the show seems bad and the discussion about orgasm is fishy. Nearly 12 callers participate in the show.The discussion about children sounds better in the overall show but probably there is no goal in the show and the rating is 1 out of 5 from Rathina, India.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Well, the weekend is here and more than anything, Cooper's radio show is something that helps me unplug. We have two tattoo-free guests at the Ritual for the 94th - David's mom Clara and funnyman, 212-pounder Paul Conyers! After attending to an early caller through the glass, the three settle in to get things rolling. Well, what do you know - it's truly a family show this week and Sr. is right - even a Jesus can't get through the Mexican border right now, let alone applying for asylum on the second coming. And if you ask me - we sure could do with a lot more loosey-goosey hippie rabbis, especially in the Middle of East or the Middle of West rather, looking from my side. You know what, I'm not sure if I've heard a more articulate funnyman on the show before, not to mention the spot-on German accent - he had me cracking up all the while. The lill' trip down comic-memory lane was pretty insightful too. Before bringing the curtains down, both David and Paul make a quick plug for the shows they have lined up - sounds like fun. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with nearly 4 stars - I've got enough to publish a paper on bum-wipes now, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Cooper is back at 1026 Valencia and the train wreck rolls on - to episode 93 this week (Wow!), with the versatile and multitalented Clara Bodacious in the guest seat. The show gets off the ground with quite a few callers from the other side of the glass. Clara's friend and fellow performer, Barbie then rings in and an interesting conversation ensues. Vampire fetish, period-sex towels, and hemorrhoids - can't say I've heard all three in one sentence before. Clara brings up something I hear all too often these days - how much it bothers parents to bring up children in the era of technology. And before long we're on communes and goat farming - boy we're running the whole gamut here! The outside phone line sees from frantic activity towards the very gay end of the episode, with our very own Banksy reveal - that was a good one, Clara! And just when the thought crossed my mind that Bond may have fumbled his Daylight Savings clock - I hear that all too familiar laugh. Boy does he work on his props or what?! - sounds like Mr. T has got a drop though. We sure have a transatlantic meeting to look forward to later this month. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with 4 stars! - that was more blood &amp; hemorrhoids than I could take for an evening - but sill fun, I think.</itunes:summary>

Things get moving with Cooper unpacking a rape joke, which made me cringe slightly. When it comes to things like having a gift of the gab, our guest proves to be more than a match for David. A few interesting callers from across the glass divide and Miranda's call line the first hour - I'll probably see pink salmons in a whole new light from this day forth. But 'Adolf Gasser' has to take the weird snippet award for the week. David's childhood friend Jacob calls in and spills some of their peccadillos, which set things up nicely. Our man from across the pond then calls in and the show kinda enters a whole new level of reality. It was hilarious and painful at the same time. Oh yeah, talk of the Atlantic Ocean being a cock-blocker! - Well, maybe not for our drone man - but that's a good one Pamela! Oh Jenny, my Jenny! - full marks to her for being a sport. Oh boy, that was a cracker of a closing from Pamela! That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with 5 stars - that sure went off the rails in the end but in a good way, I think.</itunes:summary>

The first caller is Gay Gallow, who goes on to talk about his date/break up. They all go on to discuss polyamory relations. Then next boring discussion is on Martinis. The discussion was so boring, Gallow hung up without saying good bye. Finally another caller Miranda, who had to hold on till they dispensed off with Rommey. The next call is from a person who is confused about the show. This the most boring episode in recent times. Get some better guests, David.

Sounds like the show has even moved up the ladder with a new station picking up the feed - way to go! David gets things rolling with his usual drill and introduces his guest Tracy Nguyen. However, the episode gets off the blocks with a whimper. Tracy brings up something that I've often wondered too - why does David get worked up when someone refers to the show as a podcast?! Miranda then makes an early call in and the three get chatting. But it doesn't take long before our leading man from across the pond calls in. Between tinder swipes, ass wipes, getting rimmed, boob squeezes and being on call to Her Majesty's Drone service, our man in London still makes his Friday morning dates. That's commitment! Tony comes to Cooper's rescue when he needs him the most - kinda like a laxative for the show (although Tony might argue it's the other way around!). After Tony hangs up, Cooper and Tracy strive to salvage the rest of the episode. Cooper goes on to play a hilarious clip from Burning Man. The curtains come down for the week with a karaoke duet which to be honest, cracked me up. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this sing-along episode with 4 stars - that turned out well in the end, I think.</itunes:summary>

They have a long Q&amp;A. Then Dan has a verbal diarrhea on the Kardashians, who he hates to the core. The next caller is the show regular, Tony. Tony has testy relation with Dan. Then we get a dose of typical Tony humor, but its quite subdued. The last caller is another regular Miranda, who has fought with her. One of the boring David Cooper shows in recent times.

Then we get a dose of typical Tony humor, but its quite subdued. The last caller is another regular Miranda, who has fought with her. One of the boring David Cooper shows in recent times. This is Karti from India rating the show a 1 out of 5.</description>

[Editor's Note: a pseudonym] Munette is podcast host herself and also does editing for it. She is self-proclaimed smelly person and baths only 4 times a week which is more than David. They go on to discuss an episode which they had shot together and David uploads its only for her mom to find it. There the show kicks off its dick, masturbate jokes. The part where they rename Munette as Ma-anally was hilarious. The first guest is the old time favorite Miranda. They all go on to discuss their porno likes and dislikes. The next caller is the crazy guy Tony, another regular. And the show goes to another level. I am beginning to like the show, its wicked vulgar sense of humor is fun and quite enjoyable. This was one of the better shows after a couple of previous shows. Thanks for taking my name in show, i would love to call the show.

He has a beautiful voice. It has all the typical jokes with whole loads of cuss words like penis, gay jokes. Can be disgusting. Then Tony, another regular on the show, calls up. The discussion of the stripper show was quite good. The next caller is Miranda, yet another show regular. Erica's answer on her early marriage was heartfelt and felt genuine.

            <itunes:summary>David takes the show to the East Coast this week - to the Hamptons where his brother Jon is having a gay bachelor party with some of his mates. The show is almost a non-starter with Jon's mates who promised to help, washing their hands off at the 11th hour. But David persists, and persist he does - albeit with the help of Miranda and Tony - Jon chips in as well. You know, with the kind of upbeat radio persona Tony puts on week after week, you sometimes tend to take it for granted that he may be the same in real life too. It was refreshing to hear him open up and take us for a peek behind the curtains - only to be derailed by McNuggets! - yes Tony, only on the David Cooper show indeed! Well, Tony manages to get himself invited for Jon's wedding later in the summer, and I have a feeling he's going to make it. If he does, it sure is gonna be a riot! Sounds like we have a few interesting weeks lined up. David gives next week's episode a heads up before deciding to give the nuggets his undivided attention. Nuggets on alcohol?! - that could be a wind-breaker isn't it? I hope not. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with well, no stars (to borrow from Tony - we're not in a competition, are we?). That was a decent listen, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Oh yeah, the Cooper train wreck is back with another episode - the redhead going blonde, Sara DeForest is this week's guest. The two get the show going by striking up some banter before David reveals that his ex is having a child - listening to him talk about it, you kinda get the feeling that it's been on his mind a lot - or maybe not. Wrong Sara to the wrong Gabe! - insane indeed. Wonder what the odds on something like that would be!? Talking about odds and sanity, you don't have to go far to find someone who pushes both - it's our Bond from across the pond! Apparently Tony has been going around trying to get random people to wear David's cutout face masks - a topless woman with Cooper's face sounds hilarious - looks like Tony has his work cut out. On second thoughts, he might pull it off while he's out walking his dog - I wouldn't be surprised. After Tony hangs up, a couple of persistent teenagers ring in from the street and throws Cooper off, slightly. It's Sara's turn when he hears David's views Ali Wong's comedy. I reckon Cooper was on to something when he talks about one's choice to get offended. A drowsy sounding Miranda calls in before the curtains go down for the week. Always something, indeed! That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this episode with 4ish stars - that went alright, I think.</itunes:summary>

You know, I still can't figure out why Tony goes off the rails each time David has a go at his physical appearance - he can do better! Our guests get some game talk going and Miranda rings in just as things were warming up. But boy did she have me cracking me up today - there was a Mohammed in there as well! - talking about classic liners, that one's up there! And what a nice thought to finish the episode, Michelle.

            <itunes:summary>Made it indeed! - a hung-over David is back at the Ritual for #80, with Annie and Dan Linley returning as guests. The trio gets the bantering going on a laid-back note. David brings up the recent outing of Shitbag and Dan is not happy with how the show went. An apologetic David floats the idea that he could take a step back and have someone else fill in. From what I can make out, the show is still in it's infancy and it's probably a good time to try if something new works. Annie's plug for her new show, 'Bottomless Standards' is interrupted by the evening's first caller- Womanizer's greatest fan! Talk about silken ocean waves and minute long crests - you know, I was thinking - maybe the Germans could use that line for one of their ads, but good luck matching Miranda's conviction. Tina, the next caller may have tripped on some outcropping and hung up. And yeah, think I was a bit Arachnophobic too but I've gotten over it over the years - trekking in a rainforest sure helps! Vic rings in and takes things on a different tangential. For a second there, I wasn't sure whether to feel happy or sad for our Obama fan. That aside, it sounds like Dan has some interesting shows in the pipeline. That's me, Sam from the Far East rating this rather drivel of an episode with 2 stars - that could've been better, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>I can't understand the motive of the show. I don't know what he tries to talk. The starting itself is a great mess. He shouts unnecessarily during the conversation. It makes me very tensed and angry and I got frustrated in the starting itself. It was a great insult for David Cooper by the first caller. The question was how come this show has come up to 79 episodes and it was nice question by the caller. But the answer by him was irritating that he cannot know to answer for this question. He was adding it as child and the words used in the shows is unpleasant. Even the guest using the words such as f**k randomly. No one can hear this type of shows. The first caller was dating. Unnecessary talks takes place in this show. The guests does not behave themselves properly as the guests. First of all f**k your show. Oh my god what type of show is this? I can't even hear it for a minute. It was very boring with unwanted talks. Why this show is conducted by him? In my personal thoughts this show is waste of time filled only with unwanted talks. There is no useful things in this show. Highly frustrated after listening to the talks. The title of the show is not at all suit with the talks. They are thinking that it is going well but it was the whole mess. In order to pass their own time they are conducting this stupid show. This show makes me highly angry because of their unwanted stupid talks. &quot;Fucked on the pizza&quot; Is this very important for this show? This show is not to discuss about each other's bed experience. I am really confused whether this is a show or a matrimony?? I can't understand the second caller's motivation. Why he called and what he wants to get things from these stupids? Unwanted noises behind the shows is not at all a good sign for a valuable show. From this the importance they have given to the show is known by us. A 20 year old girl is all the chief guest for this show. They are just making fun of each others. They are getting tired or not after listening to this stupid I get really tired and frustrated. I think both the men have come to know the details of the girl who have come as a guest because she is a small girl and they are asking about the boy friend . It is very stupid behavior. Would you sleep with your sister is a f**k question. I am really depressed because of this show. They are even insulting the callers. What is there about to talk about AVI and the dating with it. The conversations is jumping as they like. There is no order and it was not at all like a show. Full of sexual talks. David is very proud to say him as a gay and it was very stupid. Oh my god I can't bare their idiotic talks. In this situation he is singing and can't able to hear that voice. But for my relief I can hear the song for my relaxation but it was also not played full and while playing the song the idiotic talks is interfered. The question of the fifth caller is somewhat useful I think but it was messed with the stupid answers. They are talking stupid always. If I was an anchor I would have done it better than David. I can't even accept this as a radio show. I beg Mr.David Cooper not to conduct this type of show hereafter. I can't bare this type of unnecessary talks. It they asked me to rate this show I will always rate this as negative as I can. Very bad, worst show I have ever heard till now. That went well, I think. I am Karishma.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>[Editor's note: the following antagonization of David Roth involves fictitious statements by David Cooper.] David ropes in fellow comedian Matt Naderi, as the stand in guest for the episode. Naderi is Maz Jobrani lite and sounds pretty laid back. After a brief call from his (apparently crazy) roomie, he goes on to talk about his Dad, who moved to the country before the Iranian Revolution. David Roth (of Courtyard by Marriott fame) is our next caller, and he doesn't exactly mince his words when it comes to what he thinks about the show. After some pushing and prodding, Cooper admits that he's had some beef with Roth and makes an effort to come clean. Jamie Bond, all set to leave on his next mission to the Korean Peninsula, interrupts the call. I can't help imagining what new shit he's going to stir up - we should get a progress report this time, next week. For all you know, the South Koreans might fly him to Singapore for some fruity comic relief while the two overweight men meet, Trump and Tony. Straight shooter and WebEx hater Miranda then calls in to put Cooper in his place, followed by Roth who rings back to clear the air. After Roth hangs up, Naderi shares some of his experiences living abroad. Cooper brings the curtain down for the week, but not before a few plugs for shows both the men have coming up. That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this episode with 4 stars - that went pretty sour free, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>David Cooper had a long talk with his guest, Joseph Ugalde who is supposedly a 70 year old musician. I mean I am unsure whether this was a joke or what since I don't know who this Joseph Ugalde really is even after googling him yet some parts of the show were funny and entertaining yet in the same time, some parts of their discussion were annoying and appeared to be heading nowhere. Although I was extremely skeptic initially regarding this guest, at some point he actually freestyled a song and his singing voice was nice- that went well, I think! At some point, a caller went live on air, her name was Miranda, she appeared to have an obsession with her feet and kept talking about a &quot;foot peeling&quot; chemical she got off Amazon - this part was really weird. Like this wasn't weird enough, the rest of the conversation with the caller included discussions on masturbation, vibrators and.... Drake?! Anyway, considering I've heard way more absurd and pathetic radio shows, George from Romania will rate this episode 2 stars!</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Just the segway to the weekend I needed - the show about nothing is back! Chicken John is in the guest seat this week and our very own Colonel Sanders proves to be an opinionated man with the gift of the gab - starting with the upcoming California gubernatorial primaries and punctuated by side-boobs, we get a run down on the state of affairs, Qatar and even mundlebread! That was a good one, David! The first caller turns out to be a sport and lightens things a bit. The Chicken is so right about Trump supporters. Nixon and Universal Basic Income, really? - I learned something new today. The ever so sharp Miranda then calls in and I thought she had someone cling onto his plumes there for a few minutes; even gave me a goal for the rest of the month -brush my teeth with showmanship! One second thoughts, maybe not - it sounds too toothpaste heavy. Before we close for the week, Jamie Bond gets on the line after a night out from across the pond. Is that 138 miles or kilometers per hour?! Cos I thought they had real strict speed limits in England. Oh I forget, Bond makes his own rules after all. And you know what, I reckon you should have 'Tony time' towards the end of the show and close on a high note. That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this highly infotaining episode with 4.5 stars - that went pretty well, I think.</itunes:summary>

That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this highly infotaining episode with 4.5 stars - that went pretty well, I think.</description>

            <itunes:summary>Woo 72! - that's quite the journey right there! As this week's guest, David has the comedian Michael Makarov who is taking some time off after fixing an election or two. Michael reveals that he likes being at the Ritual. Miranda gets a call in quite early and the show suddenly comes alive - Face yoga, Cunnilingus advice, free bleeding tales and Raspberry Pis sets the stage for our caller from England - the man who tries his best to never make anyone uncomfortable - the man who usually has me going, WTF is he on?! After Tony hangs up, Makarov and David try to decide whose show it is! Oh boy! David Roth (of Courtyard by Marriott fame) is our next caller and three catch up on random goings on and Uncle Igor. Drama Queen Cooper then revisits his relationship with his older brother and for a few minutes, I thought we were in Dr. Phil territory. Before bringing the shutters down for the week, David talks about the two interesting shows he's lined up. And I agree, teenagers in groups can be tricky. That's me, Sam in the Far East rating this episode with 3.5 stars - that went bleed free, I think.</itunes:summary>

They get off the block by sharing notes about the legend of - who else other than Jamie/Borat Bond, our man from England with a villainous laugh. Celeste has been learning the ropes about being a comic with David buoying her on. We have the first caller for the evening and it's time for some (very toned down) Tony baloney - live streaming this week from close to the Wall the Mings put up. Wonder if they had any fake IDs back in the day, you know to get through the Wall - maybe not. The baloney aside, the thought of going to the Fringe in Edinburgh sounds brilliant. Celeste goes onto talk about her experience living away for the first time. And Miranda proves once again that she can hold the mirror up to David when it matters. After the Sh*tbag reveal, Miranda's sister calls in, followed by the other David a.k.a GroupChatter. Some straight talking and good banter ensues. Before closing, David reminds Celeste about the show he has in the works with Dan Linley and offers her a join in. That's me, Sam in Borneo rating this episode with 3.5ish stars - that went pretty abortion free, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>Episode 70 it is and a sleepy David goes through his intro drill and introduces this week's dog loving, truth speaking guest, Nick Katz. And this week's headline reads - is James Bond really loosing it? From what I hear, looks like he's decided to change his first name to Borat! Oh well! After sharing some interesting comic field notes, Nick and David get the first caller on the line - how else could it be other than Borat taking some trivia-time off between drinking alone in a bar, watching people use chopsticks and not sleeping much. And I had one of those bulb moments and got reminded of watching Steve Jobs introduce 'Podcasting' in 2005 - the man termed it as a concatenation of 'iPod' and 'Broadcasting' - you're right, David. Moving on, Nick reveals his Jewish credentials and a pretty elaborate one at that. An upbeat sounding Miranda then calls in (I think the 'Womanizer' is back in action!). Jokes aside, it's always nice to hear her. David then returns the call to someone who tried calling in and the two end up talking to an even keeled (or maybe up &amp; down) Patrick from Texas. The super-texter/long term fan, Vic then calls into the show - he comes across as a you know, an even keeled person. He brings down the curtains for this week, just about. That's me, Sam from a cafe in the Far East rating this episode with 3 stars - that went pretty easy-peasy, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>The show about nothing does a 69! - Now that's something! Fellow comic Ray Connolly is back in the guest seat for the third time (really!?, maybe it's the coffee!). The two dive in talking about Ray's family situation and his staycation pursuits. Apparently the first time Ray came on the show was Episode 2, which sounds like a real pickle from the way David keeps talking about it. David runs Ray through the show's how-we-got-here story and the two go on to share some field notes from the comic circuit. And suddenly things light up(or not) - we have James Bond working the transatlantic lines again - giving English lessons and spilling his expertize on things Russian. Ray tries to hold it together, but you could tell that he wasn't too impressed with Bond. Our fact checker for the day (Miranda) calls in with, well - some facts. Hmm has the 'Womanizer' run out of batteries?! David tries his uncomfy-questions-list on Ray again, but he doesn't bite. The son of Cony has a show coming up next week and to the question whether he'll ever be back at the Ritual on a Thursday night - time will tell! . That's me, Sam from an Airbnb place in the Far East rating this episode with 2 stars - that could've been much worse, I think.</itunes:summary>

Turns out the articulate Bronson who likes to walk, moved to San Francisco about a decade ago. The two just about ease into their conversation, when we get the first caller - and who else could it be?! - the James Bond from England is back doing what he does best on early Friday mornings (his time) - dialling long distance while searching for his clothes! After Tony hangs up, Bronson opens up about her Dad who came across as a rather colorful person. David gives Bronson's stepmom a call - a trip down memory lane and some kerf(L)uffle later, Bronson's straight-shooter stepbrother also joins the conversation - yeaayhh! Miranda calls in and wonders whether Davids' been on Viagra?! - well, maybe that's an appropriate question for Tony - just thinking out loud! Streams, ADD, bleeps (more like, missing ones), Bronson's nerdy pursuits, and stemmy mushrooms keep things streaming. You know what, I think Bronson made a wonderful guest and her folks were great too. Good on you, David! Aside from the ritual lined up at the month end, Bronson has a show in May.

Crosstalk, pubes, vagina fleshlight, suction pumps, cake-farts, crosstalk and some more crosstalk later, Tony comes to the rescue with his penis-puzzle! Oh boy, how does he come up with shite like that at 5:30 in the morning?!! After he hangs up on a cuppy-slappy note, Donkey proceeds to give us the load on her pubes, setting off a T-M-I alert in my head (too much information!) and drawing Miranda into the conversation. David then asks Donkey if they can call her Mom - she is reluctant but relents after David agrees to her condition. They are unable to get Mom on, but Donkey's Dad calls back and takes the show down the PG route for 15 minutes - to be honest, Dad sure came across as a charming and big-hearted fella! Before handing over their space to the cleaners, David Copper T.P says that his show at the Deli will be on in May. That's me, Sam from a backpacker's hostel in the Far East rating this episode with 3 stars - that had a slow start but came alive towards the end, I think.</itunes:summary>

David kicks things off by addressing her bladder - don't think Tracy saw it coming but she dodges it well. Tracy feels she needs to be socializing more - well if you ask me, spending a Thursday evening on a show about nothing is a pretty decent start! Celeste calls in and Tracy shares some insight on Asian ways - which I thought was kinda true. David reveals his nurturing side and tries to help Celeste learn the ropes of becoming a comic. I then hear Kimchi being mentioned in a rather poopy circumstance, which wasn't exactly music to my ears cos I had one earlier and will be hitting the sack after this. Our new Womanizer fan then calls in and I don't know if it's her or some weird Womanizer side effect they didn't put on the box - she sounded slightly off it this week. The show then truly comes alive with a call from the middle of the Mediterranean - it's Jamie Bond masquerading as Johnny English - a.k.a Tony from London! Tracy tells David that he should consider having Tony on the show - that'll be some riot! Before the curtains go down, Tracy reveals that she has some shows coming up in April. That's me, Sam from a hostel not too far from the Vietnamese border (with Cambodia) rating this show with 3.5 stars - that went quite smooth and easy, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>The show about nothing rolls into town again - this time with Marcus Peverill in the guest seat. Marcus travelled south to be part be part of the show and our boy is turning 21 soon, having spent over a year trying to be a comedian while juggling two jobs. Celeste (David's Social Media Intern) happens to be friends with Marcus and she has a bunch of questions for him, which David tackles one by one. Among other things, Marcus reveals that he has no interest in putting it up Hitler's back burner. C*nts, an absent father, Dr. Pepper, Miranda's new German Womanizer and clits reveling under pleasured air just about kept me in my seat - until the phone rang. And guess who was back? - Who else could it be other than Tony?! He wasn't going to stay away for long, was he? After we learn about Tony's exploits in Athens, David tries to get Marcus to open up about his Dad followed briefly by some 'women-logic' from New Jersey. Miranda gets on the Find-Sanchez case and gets her browser fired up while David brings down the curtains for this week. As a closing note, Marcus plugs the shows he's got lined up for the next few weeks. That's me, Sam from a backpacker's den in the Far East rating this show with 3 stars or maybe 3.5! - that went alright, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>The comedian Dan Linley is the stand-in guest. The man wastes no time in getting things rolling by narrating the reason why he came in late - who would have guessed? - he got held up with some hazardous poopyactive waste that refused to slide!  Just the kind of entree you need to sit back and enjoy the show. Dan is irked further when he is asked about his foot fungals. After David makes a rather pointed comment about his brother, Dan wonders why he always tries to rile people up. At this point, I'm thinking - where is Tony when you need him?! But it's Sam and Justin who call in, followed by fellow comedian David Roth. Porcupines, Dan-edonia and a phonetic lesson keep things moving. Dan suddenly blows his top after watching someone litter and he steps out to see if he can get a whiff of Mr. Inflamed Testicles. Dan then tries to establish his handwash/pee-streaming credentials. For all you know, with a bit of work he could have his own Netflix show! Or maybe not - the man is too caught up trying to establish that he is not a misogynist. Dan mentions that he has some shows lined up and the two sign off to a Stones track. That's me, Sam from Singapore rating this episode with 4 stars! And if I'm ever at the Courtyard by Marriott, I'll have something to smile about - that went kinda well, I think.</itunes:summary>

David Cooper's chat was so funny with some bad words, but that's not seen as a big issue in this episode. It was great when he mostly accepted to improve the episode which was requested by Indians fan Banu and Svatish. Not only from them, from my side also i request you to run this show with a reasonable topic. As the show has international following, the topic may also bring any changes. But David Cooper is really a great man who publicly read out the comments given by the followers though it has bad reviews. Overall the show was good to hear and it was a funny 2 hours spent in my life listening to a topic less speech. Miranda girlfriend of david is nice to listen. Anoop from India rate this episode 3.5 stars. That was well I think.</itunes:summary>

He reveals that he got to meet up with David's social media intern Celeste and his girlfriend Miranda, while in San Francisco. I breathed a sigh of relief when our man was off after giving us some ginger insights. David gets Miranda to call in and we get the load on David's bottom burps, among other things. David admits to Justin that he wasn't a huge fan of him earlier and the two talk things out. David narrates how a fellow comedian helped him name the show and two take a trip down memory lane. It was interesting listening to a comedian's take on how a comedian ought to be and the interplay between being a designer and an artist. Justin reveals that his favourite comedian growing up was Richard Lewis. On a closing note, David discloses that he's going to be co-hosting a new radio show with a real interesting setting. The episode closes before Tony can come around for another ambush. That's me, Sam from Singapore rating this train wreck (David's words, not mine) with 5 stars - that went really well, I think.</itunes:summary>

David mentions that he had a rough upbringing in Toronto, Canada and he took to Lego at a very early age. A caller then dials in from a few blocks away - the man happens to work for Mozilla (of Firefox fame). The next caller Tony (visiting from the UK) was hilarious but he probably maxed out his cards paying for roaming. I was glad when he finally got off - the show was going a bit sideways at that point. David struck an apologetic tone with Oli for his teeny gaming persona but Oli was pretty sporty about it. And Tony pops up again - does that bloke ever give up? Christian (from the gaming days), whom David tried to call earlier in the show, leaves a text but he's unable to get past his voicemail. And guess what? - think I'll step out for a pizza too.

David is so proud to announce himself as a gay and I feel sorry about Miranda. Except he's not really gay i think. It's stupid. The show had a mix of sh*t stuff like &quot;grabbing microphone from female reporter&quot; and pussy, a bad comedian who made bad rape jokes, Alexander the architect, hearing munching snack sounds, f*cking the right pussy, pee hole, jewish pee and lot of poop. The story about peters' ex-girlfriend was bit sad, at last the were trying hard to pull in callers with expired snickers bait, as no one turned up to call the show, i am not suprised no one called so they called Miranda who pulled David's leg and tried to spoil his name as much as possible. It sounded more like a long boring discussion, I would like to pay David a million dollar (If I had) so to stop doing this show. Swatish form India rates this stupid podcast with 1 star, I would rate with -1 if it is allowed. Very bad. [Editor's note: a -1 star rating is allowed.

Suddenly, Josi makes a call and talks David if he is making profit out of the show. David suggests Celeste that Josi is very free spirited. Celeste who believes in pro-abortion tries to make her Mom believes that she loves guys and she is not lesbian. That went well, I think. Elisa makes a surprising call and tells David that she is calling to the show because Celeste is her friend and she wants to say hi and also tells that it's appropriate to be friend with a 19 years girls but David insists that don't call him daddy on social media. In final part, host David talks about Jewish tradition and circumcision and concludes the show thanking guest Celeste for giving him idea to have one psychic in the show.

            <itunes:summary>&quot;The This is going well, I think with David Cooper is a funny, interesting can relate in this type of radio episode I have ever listened his sense of humor he is kind of catching someone's will to share their experiences and he can maintain a good conversation that he can give twists like throwing funny jokes and still keeps on holdign back on the boundaries of getting totally offending compliments to his guests and with the caller's in the episode. There are caller's in the episode that are connected with Atish Mehta like his sister who interviewed his brother about his weird things he like to do were Atisha felt awkward but still he keeps on riding the questions showing his natural way of attitude of being easy to be with and also his girl friend Nicole, David played funny jokes to her saying to Atisha about her, he says 'What is the taste of her butt hole?&quot;&quot;, and this questions really made me laugh too much. Lots of callers were on the line up asking questions to Atish about his passion as a DJ and makes him proud, David rank his episode least of all, he really hates his own show. that do not make sense to me. I am Dhruv from India, indian like atish and he remind of me of that and I am rate this episode with 4.5 stars.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>I don't know how could someone record such crap and call it a radio show. The entire show is a mess from the host David cooper choosing his girlfriend Miranda as the guest to fill in because the actual guest didn't come. It is an Unprepared and unplanned show, they both don't know what to talk about. Adding fuel to the fire, a woman started yelling outside the door asking to turn the speakers down. This greatly brought the David's motivation down that he had to say millions of filler words like aahh.. uhmm for the initial 12 minutes. Its nice to hear David panic and ruin the show, but honestly its already ruined from before they start. They choose topic &quot;Noise pollution&quot; then moved to &quot;What is difficult about Christmas this year?&quot; where none of them went well, I think. The first caller called in to play some music instead of talking, that was again a bad beginning, the second caller tried to figure about what the show is really about, but no one had an answer. David is never anwer that question. The third caller Erica spent a lot of time talking literally nothing but nitrogen truck and solace. Towards the end a lady whom they called solace called just to talk about her bad day at work. Swatish form India rating this pathetic show with -1000000 stars.</itunes:summary>

Cooper tried to pull out her age and got it as 32, not all women would say that, they started the show with a scam call discussion which is quite boring, and the first caller Jonathan, 19 made the show even worse. The man high on weed speaking in a rate of less than 5 words per minute just called in to have good time, which no one had. He made the boring show terribly boring. Every effort of cooper to get something out of the caller went in vain. The call form wick who is a fan of cooper, was somewhat lively. and Miranda, Cooper's girlfriend spoiled his image as much as possible. Throughout the show Marcy was upset that it wasn't a prepared show with no set. Marcy is really hate cooper, which good, I like this I hate Cooper too. They gradually ended the show by munching food. Overall the show is a junk  boring podcast to waste time listening to. Swatish from India rating it with 1 star. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

Tracy Nguyen is the today's guest on the show, this her second time here. The kick off their banter over Chelsea Handler issue. They start to bash Jews, gays. They move on to the topic of Tracy going to Japan. Its almost halfway through the show but there is no caller yet. I am not surprise honestly, because they are not nice to listen or talk to. Some of their jokes are good but most of them leave a bad taste in the mouth. The first caller is orders a Pizza. They also discuss their childhood spanking, with Tracy being quite graphic in her description of it. Finally they receive a call from Ben from Tinder. The next caller, Miranda, discusses The Robot Unicorn, the Facebook game. Then come more Jew jokes. Looks like i wasted out an hour of my life on this stupid show, i wonder who and why do they pay for this show. This is Maru from India rating this episode 1 star. That went well, I think.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>David Cooper and Caliban started the show. Cooper tried to pull information about Caliban's personal life, he tried to elope from the topic by giving general information. Well later both of them are not happy about their partners. The concept of the first woman telling &quot;Riding bicycle without a shirt&quot; and expecting not getting objectified seems real challenge these days. The ampersand gal was quite not open about being polygamous, still she calls her partners as friends, thats crazy though. Women bicycle without shirt without getting objectified! Cooper and Caliban were staying at some point that no techie would be listening to the show, still Caliban gave a lot of techie tech information. Both lost their mind when that crazy women just called in to get &quot;Attention&quot; sounded super crazy and I want to do it one day. The other callers sounded normal, and one caller refused to discuss about personal life though that is what the entire show is all about, LOL why call? While Cooper and Caliban were talking about getting butterflies on first few parties, that is so real, and anyone would relate to it. Talking about first sex, that is a memorable experience for anyone for topping the most nervous moments of life, so real. Afzal from Lahore give episode two half of five stars.</itunes:summary>

The concept of the first woman telling &quot;Riding bicycle without a shirt&quot; and expecting not getting objectified seems real challenge these days. The ampersand gal was quite not open about being polygamous, still she calls her partners as friends, thats crazy though. Women bicycle without shirt without getting objectified! Cooper and Caliban were staying at some point that no techie would be listening to the show, still Caliban gave a lot of techie tech information. Both lost their mind when that crazy women just called in to get &quot;Attention&quot; sounded super crazy and I want to do it one day. The other callers sounded normal, and one caller refused to discuss about personal life though that is what the entire show is all about, LOL why call? While Cooper and Caliban were talking about getting butterflies on first few parties, that is so real, and anyone would relate to it. Talking about first sex, that is a memorable experience for anyone for topping the most nervous moments of life, so real. Afzal from Lahore give episode two half of five stars.</description>

            <itunes:summary>David Cooper starts the show with some very useless information. How can every show be the last episode? How did they even get to episode 49? It's not a funny joke. David introduces the comedian and tennis instructor, Dan Linley. Some insane and profane remarks are thrown around by both of the speakers as if they don't mind who is listening. They speak as though molestation and pedophilia are things that are normal, this show is honestly ungodly. Nothing they talk about is related to anything except the profanity they use. Why do people have to bring up gay-ism, sexual perversion, sexism, racism or inappropriate jokes in order to get people's attention? These guys have no idea if there is such a thing as too much profanity. Suprise, there is. To their credit, at least some constructive discussions were made on sexism and culture at some point in the show. Generally, I feel this was a complete waste of time. However, since they were able to buy the equipment and record this show, they earn a star. my name is David from Kenya and I give this episode that didn't go well, I think a rating of 1 star.</itunes:summary>

This time Alexandria love was caught by the show makers who said she just got drunk 30 minutes ago in a gay neighbourhood, and I really wonder why David is so proud to announce himself as a gay though I'm pretty sure he is not one. It's just not a good joke. Getting a call form Joseline, Miranda's sister was a surprise for them, Cooper and Alex are not happy about 18 year old Joseline's 32 year old boyfriend, and it went on like a stupid investigation. The feedback of &quot;fist in my vagina&quot; should be the exact short review for this show. The show took a serious turn when Alex discussed about sexual harassment, that was the only good part of the show. Then two callers a guy and a girl spoke together thinking it was a show about sex, lol. The show ended with call form Miranda, Cooper's girlfriend, surprisingly she had something good to talk about david when asked. Swatish form India rating this with 2 stars</itunes:summary>

Later they talk about the last time Dan was on the show which resulted in a fight between them but now they are cool. That went well, I think until David insult's Dan family again. Miranda call's again and scolds them for downgrading the quality of the show and reminds Dan to flush the toilet when he pees because it's disgusting. I agree. Then the crew gets into a deep conversation about art, functionality and electronics stores. David's brother Jon call's the show and they start talking about heartwarming stories about sibling's and how Dan brother got traumatized. David reveals that he once told Drake that if he didn't finish his high school he would never be successful, he was wrong. Adolf Hitler rates this episode 4 stores out of 5.

            <itunes:summary>This week guest Neptune comes to the David Cooper show and talks about his teenage life at Naperville. Neptune talks how the Naperville people are so openly racist. David's girlfriend Maranda calls and complains David that he does not want to hear from her. Then David talks about Indian foods and Jewish culture and festival. Then, a surprising call from Jonathan makes the show bit more interesting. Jonathan talks David that he quit smoking 5 - 6 weeks ago and he is boring with Neptune and suggests Neptune to go on a date with David. That went well, I think. In the meantime, Maranda calls back David and complains why he deselects her text. Neptune tells Maranda that she is hilarious and he loves that. David's friend Nick calls the show and shows his interest to sell his bike. David tells 'I would like to consider selling my butthole but it's not a legal thing to sell'. Maranda calls again and asks David what we gonna eat dinner tonight. Neptune tells Maranda - 'I can't wait to see you actually in person Maranda'. Ganesh from India rates this episode 3.5 star!</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>David this time has on show Ray Connolly and Dan Linley.. Dan has been third time in the show. they have big arguments about being defensive. Topic on the podcast is anti semitism. There is a lot of discussion about birthday celebrations giving cash instead of gifts. Overall lot of laughter and fun. later Vick calls in and talk about Marielle who is a musician. Personally found it very wierd not really used my time well. That did not go well, i think. Conversations get boring and  off topic comes in between. It merely seems to be more of a funny  . conversation not with much learning or knowing.  Well I think its highly simple . There are many funny jokes which don't make me laugh. Myself Insiya from India will give this podcast a rating of 2 stars. Great day guys.keep watching [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

If you are free with ample time go ahead.It is quite annoying to listen to their talks. Why would I even want to know about the Canadian parliament shooting it really helps me in no  way. Insensible talks about scooters and cars does not make sense to me at all. This podcast was just so inappropriate. Not enjoyed, I think it goes well for the three though.

His girlfriend plans to end the show early so they can have dinner later. They talk about stuff, like David hasn't bathe in five days, then about why is she dating him, she must be naive. More sensitive and disgusting topics that I really didn't want to hear about. They get a caller Rey, who I beleive does stand up comedy and they agree to host the new season at his home in his back yard. Another caller came in but it's his brother John. Another caller who is gay was asked questions, and I was very much disgusted really. This podcast had no learning aspect and I feel like I wasted my time and listened to things that only corrupted my mind, like jews, gays, fornication, cheesy jokes, and just random talks. But since they put all this time into it, Mackaina from Jamaica rates this podcast that went well, I think with just 1 star. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>&quot;That went well, I think&quot; well.. only David cooper the host of the podcast would think so. David roth the guest for the show. They thought of starting with a bang by calling Jonathan Cooper to discuss about &quot;Gay jewish hunter's club&quot; but ended up in voice mail, that shows that they were un prepared and unplanned about the show. But this always the case for David cooper. The first caller called in to know what really the show is about which both host and guest is clueless about. They both had long talks on stuffs like jews, vegetarianism, drugs, Burning man community and hyper mania. I hope Cooper's girlfriend Miranda called in because no one else did, and ended up roasting Cooper with the help of Roth. I'm sure no audience will be pleased to know about Roth's weird nipples and Cooper's half nails. The show was at peak of craziness when caller Suzuki cheese (unsure) called in just to show she is crazier than the show itself. Though her talks were very unclear, she atleast entertained with her loud singing. Miranda called in again to fill the show, Last caller Alligator and her niece called in just to make the show more boring. For the show that didn't go well. Swatish form India rating with 1 star. [Editor's note: it's not a podcast, it's a radio show.]</itunes:summary>

In this talk, david talk with his guest Annick about that, &quot;she is use vibrator or not&quot; I mean what kind of this talk make seance. How can you talk about this kind of thing. This talk where david said about her girl friend that, &quot;she is very aggressive about this kind of sh*t thing.&quot; So, that well, I think we should avoid this type of talk in publically. Annick is a comedian, but David not talk about any funny topic, Annick German, David Jew. Annick is lesbian and has lots of talks like that. I like some topic where David talk about his family. It is nice part of this ugly talk. some caller are also talk about only sex this. I am Sunil from india rate this episode 2 star. I think it is more for this. Thanks.</itunes:summary>

Chilla, a confusing man from West Africa asks about how to get booked on the radio show. David and Tracy call someone they both know to discover the most stunning revelation of the show to date: David has one friend. Celeste, a lovely former guest of the show is called and David harangues her about her recent breakup. Afterwards we call Dale, Celeste's ex-boyfriend to get his side of the story with the breakup. He starts off classy but gets in some digs. Celeste however, remained a class act.

            <itunes:summary>This week brings David’s coworkers, Palestinian-Honduran-American Kristine Holst together with long time listener, long time caller, first time guest Drew Ritter. Being in the studio is the second most exciting Kristine's done. &quot;Our topic tonight: Religion.&quot; The three discuss Judaism, Catholicism, Atheism, and hell. David tells us how sharing pictures of his anus almost cost him a friend. The three talk parasites and relate with their IBS, anxiety, hypochondria. Celeste calls in for the third week in a row, this time with her boyfriend David. We start to learn more about the teenage couple and how they found the show. David and David build rapport, even though teenage David is a Trump supporter and a raging anti-Semite. Kristine adds kissing a woman to her bucket list and talks about her perfect cervix and boyfriend. Previous guest Erika rings to tell her boyfriend Drew that he doesn’t have a parasite. Drew gets to participate in his favourite segment when the Suzuki SV650S owner calls to sell his bike, and the gang discuss genitals with him. David confronts his brother about not calling the show. Drew stands up for what he believes in: being from New Jersey, shaving his sphincter, and wearing women’s underwear. A couple on their first date give confessionals. Drew falls for a groupie. David’s girlfriend calls, tender from the death of her favourite Instagram bunny and scares off the only fan of the show. David farts on air. That went well, I think.</itunes:summary>

Kristine adds kissing a woman to her bucket list and talks about her perfect cervix and boyfriend. Previous guest Erika rings to tell her boyfriend Drew that he doesn’t have a parasite. Drew gets to participate in his favourite segment when the Suzuki SV650S owner calls to sell his bike, and the gang discuss genitals with him. David confronts his brother about not calling the show. Drew stands up for what he believes in: being from New Jersey, shaving his sphincter, and wearing women’s underwear. A couple on their first date give confessionals. Drew falls for a groupie. David’s girlfriend calls, tender from the death of her favourite Instagram bunny and scares off the only fan of the show. David farts on air. That went well, I think.</description>

            <itunes:summary>Comedian and dear friend to David, Cici Whittle joins us at 820 Valencia St. Having finished her taxes early, she's on the market and dating. Carbon dating. We quickly find out none of her suitors are good enough for her. David and Cici discuss aging, and open up about their bittersweet experiences with divorce. Chopsticks notwithstanding. Cici tell us about heroin addicted newborns. The two discuss the current president, removal of office and feces. Feces being unrelated, perhaps. Cici talks about her past and present participation in social justice movements. Our strange caller Satan from last week's episode rings. Unmasked as Celeste from Modesto, she reveals a bit about herself. Having trouble deciphering what's true, David and Cici's patience with Satan/Celeste begins to run thin. David's girlfriend calls in to remove Celeste from the line and conducts extensive Internet &quot;research&quot; on her (read: stalking). That went well, I think. Comedian and flirt Jesus U. BettaWork walks by the studio and takes David's seat causing David to incept his own show. Cici ends the show in disarray. No update on the Suzuki SV650S.</itunes:summary>

There's a book with breasts and discussion about Vanessa Del Rio's huge clitoris. David's mother calls in and after a stunning misunderstanding of how technology works, gives David a hard time for not calling her back and lays on the Jewish guilt. Satan phones and she gets sexual with Rusty. That went well, I think. Omar calls in to discuss TV and movies. David's brother compliments Rusty and talks about the complexity of having a kid when gay. Rusty opens up about his childhood while being a nerd in Kentucky and his father the bank robber. When Rusty brings threesomes up, David says he hasn't had one and he's a victim of circumstance; yet we find out the only person David can blame for not having a threesome is himself. David's girlfriend calls in to offer various negative opinions about him. Vic gives the episode a little structure by asking questions, and listens to David rant about his friend Doug. There's a secret contest hidden in the episode for an attentive listener. We find out the Suzuki SV650S is titled and ready to be sold.</itunes:summary>

David's ex-wife calls to let us know about her new love interest, who went to high school and summer camp with David. Her question for the show is: how long do you wait before you tell someone you were married to David Cooper and is that a deal-breaker? David's friend Jordan calls high as a kite and inception happens when a previous episode is played over the current one. A caller from the street on her way to Bali doesn't have time for us. A cyberbully leaves the show a menacing message demanding David wish her a happy birthday. Cole and David discuss a plan to confront the cyberbully with several callers and the episode climaxes with the confrontation. Oh yeaahhhhhhh! David's girlfriend calls and generally expresses disapproval with the way the episode went. We learn Cole's possibly in ad sales, possibly works for a newspaper, gets along with his family and has either an older or younger brother who's definitely an anti-Semite. Cole walks away saying, &quot;I came on expecting some kind of interview, but it's just therapy for David Cooper for an hour and a half.&quot; That went well, I think. We're told the Suzuki SV650S is being inspected by the CHP next week, but it's not the first time we've heard that.</itunes:summary>

With the revelation that Alex is inexplicably drawn to David, the following question comes up: would you rather be likeable or be David? Our first caller is the studio's neighbour complaining about the show. Brianna from the street calls in and tells David he looks ashy and needs lotion. Parental problems are discussed. Alex's parents think she's a loose woman. David's parents call in for the first time. His mother gives a long overdue apology, but David laments that there wasn't more confrontation. A stand-up routine about fruit is played. David's early childhood friend (and crush?) Hallie unexpectedly walks by and calls in. David asks what might have been if he'd made advances when they were thirteen. Events that happened years ago are discussed and David's definitely, definitely still not angry. David and Alex commiserate over their formative years. Alex explores feelings of self-esteem, happiness, loneliness, and fraught high school days and relates them to her experiences with stand-up comedy. Too much wine is consumed. David gets called a rape apologist. That went well, I think. The Suzuki SV650S is getting its plates registered tomorrow, but we'll believe it when we see it. Or hear it.</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>A special episode broadcast from an ad-hoc home studio in Toronto. This week, David's brother Jon joins us. At the top, Jon discusses his view of David's childhood woes and verifies claims about their mother's nudist tendencies. After an initial brawl about a guitar theft and Jon's relationship with a friendly neighbourhood pedophile, a friend calls in saying David and Jon are Jewish narcissists. There's a trumpet, there's Tequila! Jon and their brother Dan gang up on David about his imaginary girlfriend. A guest, Galo, tells us a bad story about David naked and covered in vomit this past New Years Eve. That went well, I think. David's (ex?) girlfriend grabs the mic and takes a few jabs at everyone. She stunningly fact checks David's false claims about his sexual history. A challenge arises: will the Suzuki SV650S be sold before David finalizes his divorce? Afterwards, what you didn't hear was Jon say, &quot;That was terrible, can we re-do it?&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>It's Christmas live from a crappy hotel or a decent motel with David finding himself in North County, San Diego for a bizarre impromptu episode. Joining him are childhood friends Dan Linley and Vic Dence. A caller to many but never an in-person guest, it's Vic's first time on a podcast, nay radio show in the flesh. It's a surreal experience for him. Dan refuses to cooperate and plays video games the whole time wearing disgusting socks. Dan's podcast co-host Doug from Fish Burp who's been feuding with David calls. In the holiday spirit the two make a small move toward reconciliation. Alex Love from yet another podcast, Here's Why That's Funny, rings aroused with Christmas furvor and threatens to beat David's &quot;monkey ass.&quot; The motley crew bicker and discuss their tolerance for David. Vic's diplomacy skills shine through when he mediates an argument over whether lying to your kids about Santa is sociopathic. That went well, I think. No word about the Suzuki SV650S.</itunes:summary>

An employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, he discusses with David and the Suzuki SV650S's owner the legality of the bike's exhaust system. Your host and neighbourhood Grinch David, self-styled as the President and CEO of The Lonely Jewish Christmas Club rants on about his Yuletide disdain. An anti-Semitic caller tells David to relax and not let Christmas stress him out. Another caller likens your host to Howard Stern and Rusty to Robin. Hilarity ensues. Ex-marine Rusty and David argue repeatedly over whether there are &quot;Davids&quot; in the military. David's brother calls in but quickly gets bored. Things get real when Rusty talks candidly about his brief but turbulent tour in Iraq during Desert Storm. The show ends with everyone having to pee. That went well, I think.</itunes:summary>

David's ex-wife calls in and to David's dismay discusses his receding hairline with Omar. That went well, I think. The theme of dead pets from the past two episodes continues. David's brother asks Omar why he shaves in David's signature &quot;speed groove&quot; haircut. His brother also confesses to trying to kill a woman with a motorboat. Omar shares some real moments discussing addiction, a possible higher power, and twelve step programs. Omar's fiancée calls in and aren't they sweet! The episode nearly ends with no update on the SV650S, but at the last minute we find out about its pending DMV registration.</itunes:summary>

The keen listener may note the show continues to generally just suffer. This is going well, I think. A woman calls insisting she's slept with David while failing to describe his birth defect. The Suzuki SV650S ending up in the classifieds next week looms.</description>

            <itunes:summary>The show turns into a reverse suicide hotline, callers seem concerned David doesn't kill himself. Guest Erika Kettleson joins along for the ride of support. Her boyfriend calls. Prior guest Ray Connolly relays that his mom is worried. David's brother and his entourage call repeatedly. David's ex-wife begs for the show to have questions or a format or anything. That went well, I think? There's talk of sh*t. There's a penny story. We're left wondering that if people think you have worth, can you still think you're worthless? The Suzuki SV650S remains unsold.</itunes:summary>
