    > **It's not a podcast. It's a radio show.**

    Enjoy the **incoherency**, **bad listening skills** and **self-doubt** that
    is host **David Cooper.** As I write this description I _truly_ can't tell
    you what the show is about. _This is going well, I think._ Broadcast live, there's
    comedians, callers with a **real telephone**, laughter, anger, and frustration.
    There's some very real moments. Oh, and flashing neon lights. It's a
    nightmare. Airing live _most_ Tuesdays at 4pm PT / 7pm ET, we might take your
    calls or texts at [+1 (415) 857-1155](tel:+14158571155). No promises. Listen
    live at [shoutingfire.com](#) or on [iHeartRadio]().
    _**Kill me.**_
