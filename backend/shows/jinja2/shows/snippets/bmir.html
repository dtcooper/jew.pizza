    Every year, David heads to the Black Rock Desert in Nevada to do radio at
    Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR 94.5 FM). An ephemeral radio station in
    the dust available during the Burning Man Event, the station exists at the
    interesection of weird and free-form. Wait until you hear the advertisements
    for [The Orgy Dome](#).

    David's _"official"_ job title at the station is Propoganda Director. He can
    be heard on BMIR interviewing drugged up hippies and performing experimental comedy.
    We still have no idea what any of this means.
