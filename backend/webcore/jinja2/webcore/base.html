  Okay, so I used to be an engineer. I built this myself. I could have used
  Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress or something, but I didn't. I probably should
  have focused on radio work instead. If you want to see the source, go to
  https://github.com/dtcooper/jew.pizza

  And no, I'm NOT looking for work in the tech industry. So please don't ask!
  (Or do. I'm flattered by it. Either way.)
