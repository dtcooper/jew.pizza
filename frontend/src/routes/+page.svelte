        David Cooper is a human train wreck and Canadian living in New York City. His extensive broadcasting credentials
        include having his interview requests denied by celebrities, world leaders, and restroom attendants.
      </p>
      <p>
        After growing up in Toronto, David fled to San Francisco where he was introduced to radio almost by accident:
        While dabbling in stand-up comedy, David wandered into a radio station to promote one of his shows. Something
        terrible clicked that day and there was no turning back.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        Since 2016, David has hosted various radio shows on independent stations around San Francisco, including a wacky
        call-in program (visible from a coffee shop window). His experiment with a phone booth in the desert was
        showcased in an NPR episode (long story). And at the end of 2020, David quit his lucrative career as a software
        engineer to pursue radio opportunities full-time “like an idiot” (a direct quote from his overbearing Jewish
        mother). Addressing David's mother directly in a 2022 interview, the former mayor of Toronto stated that he's
        proud of David for his minor contributions to overnight radio.
      </p>
      <p>
        David's on-air style oscillates between frenzied comedy and confession-booth sincerity, blurring the lines
        between his personal relationships and on-air ones in a way both intimate and (arguably) intrusive. David can be
        heard on his podcast
